      "We then developed a new activation assay, which showed that these G\n",

      "2014). A complex of proteins at cell-cell junctions consisting of\n",
      "PECAM-1, VE-cadherin, VEGFR2 and 3, and Plexin D1 plays an important\n",
      "role in shear stress responses including vasodilation, flow-dependent\n",
      "vessel remodeling, and atherosclerosis(Conway &amp; Schwartz, 2012;\n",
      "Givens &amp; Tzima, 2016). Stimulation of this junctional complex by\n",

      "downstream events including endothelial cell (EC) alignment in the\n",

      "shear stress exerted on the apical surface is unclear. Previous work\n",
      "suggests that activation of the junctional complex is not primary but\n",

      "intracellular domain binds to a heterotrimeric Gα protein complex and\n",
      "catalyzes the exchange of guanosine diphosphate (GDP) for guanosine\n",

      "reported, which dissociated upon application of shear stress(dela Paz\n",
      "<em>et al</em>, 2014). Differences in EC location or subtype likely\n",
      "account for some of these effects. For example, GPR68 is expressed\n",
      "specifically in small resistance arteries where it controls vasodilation\n",
      "but had no reported effect on development or patterning(Xu <em>et\n",
      "al.</em>, 2018). P2Y2 was also reported to affect vasodilation and blood\n",
      "pressure without reported effects on development or patterning. It seems\n",
      "likely that differences in local expression may thus explain some of the\n",
      "apparent multiplicity, though additional variables such as modulation by\n",
      "other inputs and coupling to different downstream effectors may also\n",
      "contribute. Understanding this GPCR-Gα protein signaling network is\n",

N=7-8 per condition. *#: p=0.0439, *: p=0.0135, **: p=0.0028, ##: p=0.0056, #: p=0.0163; Student’s t-test. F, Micro-CT of arterial vasculature after surgery. Representative reconstructed micro-CT images from LPHN2 ECKO and WT littermates on day 22 after surgery, quantified in G. n=8 per condition. ****: p&lt;0.0001, ***: p=0.0007, *: p=0.0167; two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. H, Rectus femoris muscle from thighs of 10 weeks old mice of LPHN2 ECKO or wild-type littermates, stained for CD31 and SMA to visualize the entire vasculature and arteries. Scale Bar: 100µm. I. Quantification of capillary density in the entire stitched thigh muscle images. n=3 for control and n=6 for Lphn2 ECKO. ****: p&lt;0.0001; Student’s t-test. J, Schematic of mouse treadmill fatigue test. K, Maximum running during test. n=4 for control and n=5 for Lphn2 ECKO. **:p=0.0082; Student’s t-test. L, Running distance for each mouse. n=4 for control and n=5 for Lphn2 ECKO. **: p=0.0064; Student’s t-test. M, Oxygen consumption during treadmill fatigue test. *: p&lt;0.0001; two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. Control: N=5, LPHN2 ECKO: N=4. N, Representative 3D reconstructed images at 20° downward angle of ECs plated on top of collagen gels and sprouting under static or flow conditions. ECs were stained with phalloidin; pseudocolors indicate distance from the gel surface as per the color scale on the right. O, Histograms of cell area vs. distance from gel surface in N. P, Mean sprout length. N=4. ***: p=0.0006; one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multi comparison test.   '],\n",
