TEs are a major source of endogenous dsRNAs, signaling\\nmolecules able to coordinate inflammatory responses in various\\nphysiological processes. Here, we provide evidence for a positive\\ninvolvement of TEs in inflammation-driven bone repair and\\nmineralization. In newly fractured mice bone, we observed an early\\ntransient upregulation of repeats occurring concurrently with the\\ninitiation of the inflammatory stage. In human bone biopsies, analysis\\nrevealed a significant correlation between repeats expression,\\nmechanical stress and bone mineral density. We investigated a potential\\nlink between LINE-1 (L1) expression and bone mineralization by\\ndelivering a synthetic L1 RNA to osteoporotic patient-derived\\nmesenchymal stem cells and observed a dsRNA-triggered protein kinase\\n(PKR)-mediated stress response that led to strongly increased\\nmineralization. This response was associated with a strong and transient\\ninflammation, accompanied by a global translation attenuation induced by\\neIF2Î± phosphorylation. We demonstrated that L1 transfection reshaped the\\nsecretory profile of osteoblasts, triggering a paracrine activity that\\nstimulated the mineralization of recipient cells.</p>\\n<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> dsRNA/inflammation/osteoblast\\n/PKR/transposable elements</p>\\n<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\\n<p>Repetitive elements are, in origin, parasitic transposable elements\\n(TEs) of viral derivation and during evolution have become regulatory\\nmodules of gene expression, eventually integrated into developmental,\\nresilience, and cell identity programs.(Cosby <em>et al</em>, 2019)\\n(Mangiavacchi <em>et al</em>, 2021) (Jachowicz <em>et al</em>, 2017)\\nAlthough cells have evolved several defense mechanisms to prevent\\ndeleterious uncontrolled retrotransposon reactivation,(Slotkin &amp;\\nMartienssen, 2007) increasing evidence demonstrates that\\nretrotransposons are also involved in non-pathological contexts,\\nparticularly as non-coding RNAs.(Mangiavacchi <em>et al</em>, 2021) As\\npart of resilience mechanisms, all retrotransposons are a major source\\nof endogenous double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), that serve as a cellular\\nsignaling molecule to coordinate inflammatory and immune responses in\\nvarious physiological processes.(Fukuda <em>et al</em>, 2021) (De Cecco\\n<em>et al</em>, 2019a) (Simon <em>et al</em>, 2019) (Sadeq <em>et\\nal</em>, 2021) (Chen &amp; Hur, 2022) (Zhang <em>et al</em>, 2020) The\\ntransient and controlled breaching of the activation threshold of dsRNA\\nsensors allows the integration of innate immune functions within the\\nframe of physiological processes.(Chen &amp; Hur, 2022) For example,\\nrepetitive elements transcribed during development drive RIG-I-like\\nreceptors (RLR)-mediated inflammatory signals that regulate\\nhematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) formation.(Lefkopoulos\\n<em>et al</em>, 2020) During cell replication, dsRNA-mediated activation\\nof PKR ensures proper progression of mitosis.(Kim <em>et al</em>, 2014)\\nMoreover, epigenetically mediated derepression of repetitive elements\\nleads to dsRNA production and to the activation of an inflammatory\\nresponse stimulating anti-tumor T cell immunity.(Sheng <em>et al</em>,\\n2018) Furthermore, after skin injury, dsRNAs induce inflammatory\\npathways contributing to wound healing and hair regeneration.(Nelson\\n<em>et al</em>, 2015) Several studies have demonstrated a positive\\neffect of proinflammatory mediators on bone anabolism <em>in vitro</em>\\nand <em>in vivo</em>,(Croes <em>et al</em>, 2015) (Croes <em>et al</em>,\\n2016) (Li <em>et al</em>, 2016) (Croes <em>et al</em>, 2017) (Laroche\\n<em>et al</em>, 2011) suggesting that an inflammatory reaction may be\\nharnessed for bone regenerative purposes. Indeed, sterile inflammation\\nis a fundamental component of the osteogenic microenvironment: the\\ninflammatory reaction is the earliest response to injury and is crucial\\nto initiate and orchestrate fracture repair and activate bone anabolic\\nprocesses. (Mountziaris <em>et al</em>, 2011) (Marsell &amp; Einhorn,\\n2011) (Bahney <em>et al</em>, 2019) Accordingly, a dysregulated\\ninflammation negatively impacts optimal bone regeneration, (Wheatley\\n<em>et al</em>, 2019) (Gerstenfeld <em>et al</em>, 2001) (Recknagel\\n<em>et al</em>, 2013) (Hurtgen <em>et al</em>, 2016) (Jiao <em>et\\nal</em>, 2015) and often precedes the excessive bone formation\\nassociated with heterotopic ossification and several vertebral column\\npathological conditions. (Lories &amp; Schett, 2012) (Balboni <em>et\\nal</em>, 2006) Therefore, identifying the key molecular factors\\ntriggering the sterile inflammation that precedes regeneration in bone\\nwould allow us to modulate the inflammatory reaction in a spatiotemporal\\nand contextual manner as well as to develop new anabolic strategies for\\nthe treatment of bone loss conditions, such as osteoporosis, or impaired\\nbone repair.(Roberts &amp; Ke, 2018)</p>\\n<p>Here, we show that 1) In mice, immediately after bone fracture, a\\ntransient upregulation of TEs concurs with the initiation of the\\ninflammatory stage; 2) in humans, an increased expression of repeats is\\nobserved in bones with a higher mechanical stress-induced anabolic\\ndemand and expression of TEs correlates with local mineral density; 3)\\nThe delivery of L1 RNA, but not control RNA, to human bone\\nmarrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells committed to osteoblasts\\nstimulates a unique mineralizing phenotype in a dose-dependent manner;\\n4) L1-treated osteoblasts show upregulation of inflammatory genes and\\ntranscriptional changes characteristic for the earliest stage of bone\\nrepair; 5) cytoplasmic L1 RNA is sensed by dsRNA-activated protein\\nkinase (PKR), which mediates eIF2Î± phosphorylation and a global\\nattenuation of protein synthesis; 6) the inhibition of PKR prevents\\ninflammation, inhibits translation and induces mineralization caused by\\nelevated levels of cytoplasmic L1 RNA; 7) cells transfected with L1 RNA\\nundergo significant changes in their secretome composition and initiate\\na paracrine effect stimulating the mineralization of osteogenic\\ncompetent recipient cells.</p>\\n<p>Our results indicate that TEs are induced by bone damage and\\nstimulate bone mineralization through an inflammatory response triggered\\nby dsRNA sensing and mediated by a paracrine activity.</p>\\n<p><strong>Results</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>Retrotransposon expression is triggered by fracture <em>in\\nvivo</em> and correlates with bone mineral density in human\\nweight-bearing bones</strong></p>\\n<p>Inflammation is the earliest response in fracture healing. To\\ninvestigate a possible involvement of TEs in the sterile inflammatory\\nresponse triggered by bone injury, we analyzed TEs expression in\\ntime-course RNA-Seq repository data obtained from a full-fracture bone\\nhealing mice model.(Coates <em>et al</em>, 2019) We focused on TEs\\nexpression dynamics immediately after fracture (acute inflammatory\\nstage) and observed four clusters of differentially expressed TEs (logFC\\n&gt; 0.5) between intact and post-fracture bone after 4h, a time point\\ncorresponding to the initiation of acute inflammation (Figure 1A).\\nCluster 1 includes TEs subfamilies whose expression slightly increases\\nafter fracture and during the whole healing process. Clusters 2 and 4\\ninclude TEs subfamilies that are downregulated after fracture but show\\nincreased expression at later time points. The major group, cluster 3,\\nis represented by TEs subfamilies whose expression is highly and\\ntransiently upregulated after fracture (Figure 1A and 1B).\\nInterestingly, the induction of these TEs, mostly Long Interspersed\\nNuclear Elements (LINEs) and Long Terminal Repeats (LTRs) (Figure 1B),\\nis transient and limited to the earliest phase of the inflammatory stage\\nnecessary and sufficient to initiate and orchestrate fracture repair and\\nactivate bone anabolic processes.(Mountziaris <em>et al</em>,\\n2011)<sup>,</sup>(Marsell &amp; Einhorn, 2011) These results suggest\\nthat, in bone, retrotransposon reactivation is an early event in\\nresponse to fracture, possibly linked to inflammation initiation which\\nis fundamental for a healthy healing. Indeed, retrotransposon\\ninvolvement in posttraumatic tissue regeneration was previously found in\\nother organisms.(Mashanov <em>et al</em>, 2012)<sup>,</sup>(Zhu <em>et\\nal</em>, 2012)</p>\\n<p>To assess gene expression dynamics immediately after fracture in\\nhumans represents a technical and ethical hurdle. A comparison between\\nbones experiencing different degrees of mechanical loading may represent\\nan alternative model to study stress-induced bone anabolism in humans.\\nMechanically loaded bones like the femur, which are subject to recurring\\nmicrofractures that need to be repaired, are indicated to be more\\nmetabolically active than less loaded bones, like the iliac crest, as\\npointed out by previous transcriptome studies.(Aerssens <em>et al</em>,\\n1997) (Varanasi <em>et al</em>, 2010)</p>\\n<p>We compared the expression of TEs in trabecular bone from ilium and\\nfemoral head, two different skeletal sites, the latter experiencing a\\nhigher degree of mechanical loading, anabolic demand and bone\\nturnover.(Aerssens <em>et al</em>, 1997) Femur (n=48) and ilium biopsies\\n(n=71) were isolated from a cohort of clinically well-characterized\\ndonors (refer to cohort description and Appendix Table S1 and S2). Each\\ncohort was divided into normal (BMD T-score &gt;-1), osteopenic (â2.5\\n&lt; BMD T-score â¤ â1), and osteoporotic (BMD T-score â¤ â2.5, with at\\nleast one fragility fracture). TEs show generally higher upregulation in\\nhealthy femurs (n=27) compared to healthy ilia (n=34) (Figure 1C and\\n1E). Each TEs order showed a high percentage of upregulated subfamilies,\\nfrom 60% of DNA transposon to 75% of LINEs, and a low percentage of\\ndownregulated subfamilies, from 9% of LTRs to 3% of Short interspersed\\nnuclear elements (SINEs) and LINEs, in femur compared to ilium (Figure\\n1D). These results suggested a positive correlation between TEs global\\nexpression and bone anabolic activity.</p>\\n<p>To further test our hypothesis, we compared TEs expression in femurs\\nfrom healthy donors (n=27), osteopenic (n=12) and osteoporotic patients\\n(n=9) whose bone anabolism is increasingly compromised. As shown in\\nFigure 2A, the global expression of TEs is reduced in patients. To\\nfurther assess whether TEs expression is involved in local anabolism and\\nassociated with mineral density, we divided the femur cohort according\\nto the DXA T-score measured in the femoral neck (FN). We divided the\\ncohort into âhigh BMDâ (FN T-score &gt;-1) and âlow BMDâ (FN T-score\\n&lt;-1). Globally, TEs are upregulated in femurs with high bone mineral\\ndensity (Figure 2B). In particular, more than 90% of differentially\\nexpressed TEs subfamilies are upregulated (Figure 2C). Interestingly,\\nalmost all SINE elements are unchanged between the two groups (Figure\\n2C). Finally, we assessed whether a positive correlation exists between\\nTEs expression levels and local mineral density (FN T-score). We found\\nthat approximately 30% of L1 and LTR subfamilies expressed in the\\nfemoral bone are positively correlated with local BMD (Figure 2D).\\nAltogether, these results strongly suggest a positive involvement of TEs\\nin response to stress-induced anabolic demand and bone\\nmineralization.</p>\\n<p><strong>Increased cytoplasmic L1 repeat RNA stimulates osteoblast\\nmineralization activity</strong></p>\\n<p>The <em>in vivo</em> evidence suggested a positive involvement of\\nretrotransposons in post-traumatic bone repair in mice, and a strong\\ncorrelation between retrotransposon expression and bone mineral density\\nin humans, and higher expression in loaded compared to unloaded bone. We\\nthen corroborated the results by studying the effects of increasing\\nrepeat RNA levels on differentiating osteoblasts derived from\\nmesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) isolated from femurs of healthy donors. At\\nday 5 of differentiation, a Cy5-conjugated full-length L1 RNA consensus\\nsequence was transfected. Capping, 2â-O-Methylation of 5â end,\\npolyadenylation (200 adenosines), full substitution with\\n5-methylcytidine (m5C) and 75% substitution with pseudouridine were used\\nto stabilize the RNA and to bypass the intracellular innate immune\\nsystem.(Koski <em>et al</em>, 2004) (Pardi <em>et al</em>, 2013) (Ludwig\\n<em>et al</em>, 2010) (KarikÃ³ <em>et al</em>, 2005) (Nallagatla &amp;\\nBevilacqua, 2008) (KarikÃ³ <em>et al</em>, 2008) (Anderson <em>et\\nal</em>, 2010) (Kormann <em>et al</em>, 2011) Red fluorescent protein\\n(RFP) mRNA, with the same modifications, was included as negative\\ncontrol. The exogenous L1 RNA accumulated in the cytoplasm (Figure 3A)\\nand was gradually cleared by secretion along with matrix components\\n(Figure 3B and 3C). The effect of L1 RNA delivery was tested in\\ndifferentiating MSCs from two different and unrelated healthy donors. As\\nshown, L1 RNA transfection markedly stimulated the production of\\nmineralized matrix (Figure 3D). Osteoblast mineralization increased\\ndose-dependently with the concentration of the delivered L1 RNA, in\\nagreement with saturation kinetics (Figure 3E). Moreover, the strongly\\nenhanced mineralization was highly specific for L1 RNA, as demonstrated\\nby the lack of significant changes in mineral deposition in cells\\ntransfected with negative control RNA, even at concentrations\\n100-200-fold higher (figure 3E). We also isolated MSCs from the femur of\\nosteoporotic patients and selected those showing a markedly delayed and\\nreduced <em>in vitro</em> production of bone matrix in contrast to those\\nderived from healthy donors (Figure 3F). Strikingly, also in these cells\\nwith low osteogenic capacity, the delivery of L1 RNA triggered a strong\\nmineralization response despite their clearly compromised anabolic\\nactivity (Figure 3G). These results demonstrate convincingly that the\\nectopic delivery of L1 RNA stimulates the mineralization of bone-forming\\ncells regardless of their prior intrinsic differentiation/anabolic\\npotential.</p>\\n<p>Osteoporotic patient-derived cells transfected with L1 RNA show a\\nhigher expression of early differentiation markers, with a peak 48h\\nafter L1 transfection (day 7) (Figure 3H). Bone sialoprotein\\n(<em>IBSP</em>), a late osteogenic gene, shows a similar profile, being\\nalmost 6 times more expressed in L1- than in RFP-transfected cells on\\nday 7 (Appendix Figure S1A). Strikingly, although alkaline phosphatase\\n(<em>ALPL</em>) expression slightly increases at later time points\\n(Appendix Figure S1A), its activity is not enhanced in L1-treated cells\\n(Appendix Figure S2A). However, the activity of ectonucleotide\\npyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1) is gradually and\\nsignificantly reduced by L1 RNA transfection (Appendix Figure S2B). As\\nENPP1 is a major source of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), one of the\\nmain physiological inhibitors of mineralization,(FLEISCH <em>et al</em>,\\n1966) (Johnson <em>et al</em>, 2000) (Hessle <em>et al</em>, 2002) the\\nreduction of its activity may contribute to the enhanced mineralization\\nobserved in L1-RNA transfected cells.</p>\\n<p>Altogether, these data suggest that L1 RNA induces a unique\\nmineralizing phenotype and apparently distinct from the well-known\\ncanonical differentiation mechanisms.</p>\\n<p><strong>L1 RNA delivery induces inflammatory pathways significantly\\noverlapping those involved in bone fracture repair</strong></p>\\n<p>To investigate the molecular response of osteoblasts to L1 RNA\\ntransfection, we profiled their transcriptome by Illumina RNA-Seq 24h\\npost-transfection. We found 482 differentially expressed genes (DEG)\\n(FDR&lt;0.05) between L1 and RFP RNA-treated OB (268 upregulated and 214\\ndownregulated) (Appendix Figure S3). Gene ontology (GO) enrichment\\nanalysis revealed that the early transcriptional signature of L1-treated\\nosteoblasts is typical of that of an inflammatory response (Figure 4A\\nand 4B). This is in accordance with the recent evidence of a link\\nbetween L1 and other retrotransposons accumulation in the cytoplasm and\\ninflammatory response <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em>.(Fukuda\\n<em>et al</em>, 2021) (De Cecco <em>et al</em>, 2019b) (Simon <em>et\\nal</em>, 2019) GO term enrichment analysis comparison between the early\\nstage of fracture-induced bone healing <em>in vivo</em>(Coates <em>et\\nal</em>, 2019) and differentiating osteoblasts <em>in vitro</em> 24h\\npost-L1 delivery (Figure 4A) revealed a matching inflammatory response\\nand shared upregulated pathways (Figure 4C) essential for effective bone\\nrepair.(Maruyama <em>et al</em>, 2020) (Gerstenfeld <em>et al</em>,\\n2003) (Kon <em>et al</em>, 2001) Recruitment of neutrophils at the site\\nof injury also indicates a healthy repair process, particularly in\\nbone.(Kovtun <em>et al</em>, 2016) Extracellular signal-regulated kinase\\n1 (ERK1) and 2 (ERK2), play crucial roles in bone formation(Xiao <em>et\\nal</em>, 2000) (Xiao <em>et al</em>, 2002b) (Xiao <em>et al</em>, 2002a)\\n(Matsushita <em>et al</em>, 2009) (Ge <em>et al</em>, 2007) and seem to\\nbe the most upstream initiators of tissue regeneration in\\nplanaria.(Owlarn <em>et al</em>, 2017) Upon bone injury, an initial\\ntransient stage of acute inflammation is a crucial factor in ensuring an\\neffective regeneration(Maruyama <em>et al</em>, 2020) whereas an\\nexcessive/prolonged (chronic) inflammation is deleterious for the\\nhealing environment.(Chan <em>et al</em>, 2012) (Hurtgen <em>et al</em>,\\n2016) (Clark <em>et al</em>, 2017) (Brem &amp; Tomic-Canic, 2007)\\n(Timmen <em>et al</em>, 2014) (Schmidt-Bleek <em>et al</em>, 2012)\\n(Weckbach <em>et al</em>, 2013) We followed the time-course expression\\nof âinflammatory responseâ (GO:0006954) and âimmune responseâ\\n(GO:0006955) genes upregulated by L1 RNA immediately after transfection.\\nAs shown in Figure 4D, their expression is already strongly reduced at\\nday 10 and almost entirely silenced by day 14, suggesting the transient\\ndynamics of the inflammatory response triggered <em>in vitro</em> by L1\\nRNA. This is coherent with our previous observation that exogenous L1\\nRNA is gradually secreted by the cell together with matrix components\\n(Figure 3B and C), eventually clearing out the initial inflammatory\\nstimulus.</p>\\n<p><strong>Cellular response to increased cytoplasmic level of L1 RNA is\\nmediated by PKR</strong></p>\\n<p>It has been previously demonstrated that the cytoplasmic accumulation\\nof L1-derived cDNA triggers an inflammatory response mediated by the\\ncyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING)\\ncytosolic DNA sensing pathway.(De Cecco <em>et al</em>, 2019a)\\nImmunofluorescence (IF) analysis reveals that the exogenous L1 RNA forms\\nDNA:RNA hybrids (Appendix Figure S4), suggesting that L1 RNA is reversed\\ntranscribed into cDNA after its transfection. Notably, ORF1p was\\nundetectable by WB in differentiating osteoblasts and in L1 transfected\\nosteoblasts (Appendix Figure S5), indicating that the exogenous L1 RNA\\nis not translated after transfection. To assess whether L1-induced\\ninflammation was triggered by the sensing of its cDNA, we used\\nLamivudine 3TC and G140 (Figure 5A) to inhibit the ORF2-mediated reverse\\ntranscription of L1 RNA and cGAS activity, respectively. Moreover, we\\nalso performed a siRNA-mediated knockdown (KD) of cGAS (Appendix Figure\\nS6). (Jones <em>et al</em>, 2008) (Lama <em>et al</em>, 2019)\\nSurprisingly, none of the treatments impaired the mineralization induced\\nby L1 RNA delivery (Figure 5A, Appendix Figure S6C), suggesting that the\\nobserved cellular response depends entirely on RNA sensing. As\\npreviously mentioned, repeats are a major source of endogenous\\ndsRNA,(Sadeq <em>et al</em>, 2021) (Chen &amp; Hur, 2022) and L1 RNA, in\\nparticular, is able to form intramolecular double-stranded\\nstructures.(Hur, 2019) As expected, we found a tight colocalization\\nbetween L1 RNA and dsRNA IF signal (Figure 5B). One of the main cellular\\nsensors of dsRNA, including those derived from retrotransposons, is\\nPKR.(Kim <em>et al</em>, 2018) PKR activation results in the\\nphosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2Î± (eIF2Î±)\\nand in the subsequent inhibition of global protein synthesis and cell\\ngrowth.(Donnelly <em>et al</em>, 2013) Interestingly, PKR has been shown\\nto interact with L1 RNA <em>in vitro</em>.(Kim <em>et al</em>, 2018)\\nMoreover, eIF2Î± phosphorylation has been demonstrated to promote\\nautophagy in osteoblasts and to counteract BMD reduction in osteoporotic\\novariectomized mice.(Li <em>et al</em>, 2019)</p>\\n<p>To demonstrate that L1 RNA is able to trigger a PKR-mediated\\nintracellular response, we transfected L1 RNA in the presence or absence\\nof the PKR inhibitor C16 and evaluated the levels of eIF2Î±\\nphosphorylation by western blot (Figure 5C). The delivery of L1, but not\\nRFP, strongly induces eIF2Î± phosphorylation and this effect is prevented\\nby PKR inhibition (Figure 5C). Notably, eIF2Î± phosphorylation occurs\\nalready 6 hours post-transfection. This observation suggests that PKR\\nactivation is one of the first events induced by L1 RNA, thus\\ncorroborating the hypothesis of PKR as an endogenous L1 RNA sensor.</p>\\n<p>We then characterized the proteome of cells 24h post-L1 RNA\\ntransfection by diaPASEF mass spectrometry (MS).(Meier <em>et al</em>,\\n2020a) We detected almost 8000 proteins in each sample, and observed\\nthat more than 88% of significantly differentially expressed proteins\\n(DEP) were downregulated in L1-treated cells (Figure 5D, left panel).\\nMoreover, among the top 15 downregulated biological processes and\\ncellular components were translation and ribosomal subunits (Figure 5D,\\nright panels, yellow circles), indicating that L1 RNA induces a global\\nattenuation of protein synthesis. Indeed, a cap-dependent translation\\nshutdown is the main consequence of eIF2Î± phosphorylation.(Donnelly\\n<em>et al</em>, 2013) Finally, we show that neither PKR KD (Appendix\\nFigure S6A, B) nor its pharmacological inhibition by C16 treatment\\n(Figure 5E and 5F) prevents L1 RNA-triggered induction of inflammatory\\ngenes (Figure 5E) and mineral matrix deposition (Figure 5F, Appendix\\nFigure S6B). As previously mentioned, a global reduction of protein\\nsynthesis occurs 24h after L1 transfection and only a little percentage\\nof DEP is upregulated in L1 compared to RFP control (Figure 5D).\\nInterestingly, some of the most upregulated proteins are involved in\\nautophagy and vesicle trafficking (Figure 5G). Autophagy is a crucial\\nprocess for mineralization and bone homeostasis both <em>in vitro</em>\\nand <em>in vivo</em>,(Nollet <em>et al</em>, 2014) as autophagic\\nvacuoles are exploited to secrete apatite crystals.</p>\\n<p>Altogether these data demonstrate that the PKR-mediated sensing of\\nL1-derived dsRNA globally attenuates the translation via eIF2Î±\\nphosphorylation and indicate autophagy as a possible mechanism involved\\nin L1-induced osteoblasts mineralization.</p>\\n<p><strong>L1 RNA delivery reshapes the secretory profile of\\ndifferentiating osteoblasts</strong></p>\\n<p>An inflammatory response translates into a strong secretory activity\\nand production of paracrine signals, and we therefore tested the effect\\nof âL1-primedâ osteoblast-derived conditioned medium in recipient\\ndifferentiating osteoblasts (Figure 6A). We found that the âsecretomeâ\\nof cells transfected with L1 RNA has a significant paracrine effect on\\nrecipient osteoblasts since they showed an earlier formation of\\nmineralized nodules, already 24h post the addition of conditioned media\\n(Figure 6A, right panel), and higher deposition of mineral matrix at day\\n10 (Figure 6A, left panel). We subsequently isolated bulk and\\nexosome-derived proteomes from conditioned media of untreated, RFP- and\\nL1-treated differentiating osteoblasts and characterized them by MS.\\nDifferential expression analysis of MS data revealed a unique secretome\\nprofile (for both bulk and vesicular proteomes) of L1-primed osteoblasts\\ncompared to RFP-primed and untreated osteoblasts (Figure 6B). Gene\\nOntology (GO) analysis of differentially expressed proteins showed an\\nenrichment of pro-inflammatory factors (i.e. interleukins and\\nchemokines) involved in immune response and chemotactic migration of\\nimmune cells (Figure 6C and D), crucial processes for tissue repair\\nmechanisms <em>in vivo</em>. Pro-inflammatory molecules are also a major\\nconstituent of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype\\n(SASP),(CoppÃ© <em>et al</em>, 2010) whose transient delivery supports\\ncellular plasticity and tissue regeneration.(Ritschka <em>et al</em>,\\n2017) Notably, the most enriched protein in L1-specific bulk secretome\\nis interleukin 8 (IL-8), an inflammatory chemokine involved in several\\nregenerative processes, such as skin wound healing,(JIANG <em>et\\nal</em>, 2012) therapeutic angiogenesis after stroke and ischemia,(Choi\\n<em>et al</em>, 2021) (Hou <em>et al</em>, 2014) and osteochondral bone\\nrepair.(Lin <em>et al</em>, 2019) (Yang <em>et al</em>, 2018a) Tumor\\nnecrosis factor-inducible gene 6 (TSG6) is among the top 10 proteins\\nenriched in the bulk secretome of L1-primed osteoblasts compared to RFP.\\nTSG6 is an inflammatory factor with suggestive therapeutic effects in\\ncorneal wounds, myocardial infarction, injured central nervous system,\\nchronic liver damage, and intervertebral disc degeneration.(Zhang <em>et\\nal</em>, 2013) (Lee <em>et al</em>, 2015) (Lee <em>et al</em>, 2009)\\n(Wang <em>et al</em>, 2017) (Yang <em>et al</em>, 2018b) Moreover, TSG6\\ninduces autophagy influx both <em>in vivo</em> and <em>in\\nvitro.</em>(Wang <em>et al</em>, 2017) Another protein positively\\ninvolved in autophagy and found specifically in the secretome of L1\\nprimed osteoblasts was ATG7 (autophagy-related 7). Osteoblast-specific\\nATG7 conditional knockout in mice reduced bone mass during developmental\\nand in adult age.(Li <em>et al</em>, 2018) Type 1 lysophosphatidic acid\\nreceptor (LPAR1) is also specifically secreted by L1-primed osteoblasts\\nand has proven to be positively involved in bone mineralization <em>in\\nvitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em>.(Alioli <em>et al</em>, 2020) (Gennero\\n<em>et al</em>, 2011)</p>\\n<p>Altogether, our findings demonstrate that cytoplasmic L1 RNA is\\nsensed by PKR, whose activation leads to eIF2Î± phosphorylation with\\nconsequent reprogramming of transcription and translation. The ultimate\\nconsequence of this L1-induced, PKR-mediated stress response in\\nosteoblasts is a major reprogramming of their secretory activity,\\nleading to a paracrine effect on recipient osteogenic competent cells to\\ntrigger their mineralization activity.</p>\\n<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>\\n<p>The concerted co-option of TEs markedly changed whole regulatory\\nnetworks and integrated new functions into the eukaryote genome.(Cosby\\n<em>et al</em>, 2019) (Mangiavacchi <em>et al</em>, 2021) (Carelli\\n<em>et al</em>, 2022) However, while the role of TEs as evolutionary\\ndrivers is today well-established, their contribution to cell\\nphysiology, particularly in somatic cells, remains to be elucidated.\\nIndeed, aside from their role in the nucleus, (Della Valle <em>et\\nal</em>, 2022) (Jachowicz <em>et al</em>, 2017) (Lu <em>et al</em>,\\n2021) (Percharde <em>et al</em>, 2018) TEs represent a major source of\\nendogenous dsRNA whose role in triggering inflammatory and innate immune\\nresponses in various physiological processes has increasingly gained\\nattention.(Sadeq <em>et al</em>, 2021) (Chen &amp; Hur, 2022) For\\ninstance, an early acute inflammatory response is of vital importance in\\ninitiating and orchestrating bone repair and induce anabolism leading to\\nfracture healing. (Mountziaris <em>et al</em>, 2011) (Marsell &amp;\\nEinhorn, 2011) (Bahney <em>et al</em>, 2019) Moreover, several studies\\ndemonstrated a positive effect of proinflammatory mediators on bone\\nmineralization <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em>,(Croes <em>et\\nal</em>, 2015) (Croes <em>et al</em>, 2016) (Li <em>et al</em>, 2016)\\n(Croes <em>et al</em>, 2017) indicating that the modulation of\\ninflammatory reaction is a tool to pursue regenerative strategies in\\nbone.(Roberts &amp; Ke, 2018) We found that, in the bone of newly\\nfractured mice, a group of TEs, mostly LINE and LTR, was early, markedly\\nand transiently upregulated. Interestingly, the expression of these TEs\\nwas limited to the earliest phase of the inflammatory stage. In line\\nwith the hypothesis of a positive correlation between stress-induced\\nbone mineralization and TEs activation, the expression dynamics in human\\nbone biopsies revealed a significant upregulation of TEs in the femur, a\\nbone subjected to high mechanical stresses, high turnover and anabolism,\\ncompared to ilium, not weight bearing. Furthermore, we detected a lower\\nTEs expression in donors with compromised bone mineralization and a\\nsignificant correlation between TEs expression and local BMD. We\\nhypothesized that the expression dynamics of TEs in fracture/mechanical\\nstress observed <em>in vivo</em> could mimic the immunological threshold\\nmodel of the sterile activation of dsRNA sensors as a response to\\nstressful conditions. Indeed, the transient and controlled breaching of\\nthe activation threshold of dsRNA sensors may lead to sterile\\ninflammation being integrated into physiological processes.(Chen &amp;\\nHur, 2022) To test further this hypothesis, we delivered a full-length\\nL1 consensus sequence as source of dsRNA(Hur, 2019) to differentiating\\nosteoblasts <em>in vitro</em> and showed that L1 RNA initially\\naccumulated in the cytoplasm and is gradually cleared by secretion. The\\nincreased cytoplasmic levels of L1 RNA are immediately sensed by PKR, a\\ncytoplasmic dsRNA sensor whose activation induces the phosphorylation of\\neIF2Î±(ÎÎ¹Î¼\\xa0<em>ÎµÏ\\xa0Î±Î»</em>,\\xa02018)\\xa0(âÎ¿Î½Î½ÎµÎ»Î»Ï\\xa0<em>ÎµÏ\\xa0Î±Î»</em>,\\xa02013), leading\\nto the attenuation of global protein synthesis (Donnelly <em>et al</em>,\\n2013), induction of inflammatory response, and stimulation of mineral\\nmatrix deposition. In support of the evidence that PKR is the early\\nsensor of increased L1 RNA cytoplasmic levels, we show that inhibition\\nof PKR activation by C16 prevents L1-induced eIF2Î±\\xa0phosphorylation,\\ninduction of inflammatory genes, and mineral matrix deposition.\\nMoreover, the inhibition of L1 cDNA formation and sensing by Lamivudine\\n3TC, G140, or cGAS KD does not affect the L1-induced phenotype. Thus,\\nthe evidence does not support that the L1-triggered inflammation is\\ncausally connected to a cGAS-STING-dependent sensing of cytosolic L1\\ncDNA, a mechanism demonstrated operative in senescence.(De Cecco <em>et\\nal</em>, 2019a)</p>\\n<p>L1 RNA response showed high specificity, as demonstrated by the\\ndose-dependent increase of mineralization and the lack of significant\\nchanges in mineral deposition when negative control RNA was transfected,\\neven at 100-200-fold higher concentration. Although the molecular\\nmechanism behind L1-induced stress response which stimulates the\\nmineralization activity of osteoblasts remains elusive, our results\\nindicate that L1 stimulates the mineral matrix deposition by\\nbone-forming cells regardless of their prior intrinsic anabolic\\npotential. Moreover, MS results suggested that increased autophagy, a\\nprocess crucial for mineralization and bone homeostasis <em>in\\nvitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em>(Nollet <em>et al</em>, 2014) may\\ncontribute to L1-induced hydroxyapatite deposition. Intriguingly, the\\nosteoinductive properties of L1-primed osteoblast-derived secretome and\\nthe observation that L1 RNA was gradually secreted by the cells may\\nsuggest an involvement of L1 RNA in cell-to-cell communication, in line\\nwith the recent finding of other retrotransposons (i.e. ERV) acting as\\nparacrine molecules.(Liu <em>et al</em>, 2021) This, together with the\\nobserved L1-dependent induction of CCL and CXCL chemokines and\\ncytokines, being chemoattractants of immune cells and endothelial\\ncells,(Bischoff <em>et al</em>, 2011) (Eash <em>et al</em>, 2010)\\n(Strieter <em>et al</em>, 2005) and the composition of L1-primed\\nosteoblast secretome, makes the <em>in vivo</em> delivery of L1 RNA a\\nnecessary step to evaluate its actual contribution to the paracrine\\nprocesses that orchestrate bone repair mechanisms.

Approximately 200 ng of peptide mixture per\\nsample was analyzed using a timsTOF Pro 2 QTOF mass spectrometer coupled\\nwith a nanoElute liquid chromatography system (Bruker Daltonik GmbH,\\nGermany). The sample was injected directly into an RP-C18 Aurora emitter\\ncolumn (75 Âµm\\u202fi.d.Ã\\u202f250 mm, 1.6 Î¼m, 120 Ã pore size) (Ion Opticks,\\nAustralia) using a one-column separation method. An 80-min gradient was\\nestablished using mobile phase A (0.1% FA in H2O) and mobile phase B\\n(0.1% FA in Acetonitrile): 2â25% B for 60\\u2009min, 25â37% for 10\\u2009min,\\nramping 37% to 95% in 5\\u2009min, and maintaining 95% B for 5\\u2009min. The column\\ntemperature was set at 50<sup>o</sup>C and the flow rate at 250 nl/min.\\nThe sample eluting from the separation column was introduced into the\\nmass spectrometer via a CaptiveSpray nano-electrospray ion source\\n(Bruker Daltonik GmbH) with an electrospray voltage of 1.6\\u2009kV. The ion\\nsource temperature was set to 180\\u2009Â°C and a dry gas of 3 l/min. The\\nsamples were analyzed using diaPASEF scheme(Meier <em>et al</em>, 2020b)\\nconsisting of 24 cycles including a total of 48 mass width windows (13\\nDa (m/z) from m/z 400 to 1,000 and TIMS scan range from\\u20090.63\\u2009to\\n1.35\\u2009Vs\\u2009cmâ2 (1/K0). The collisional energy increased linearly from\\n20.01 eV at 0.6 (1/K0) to 52.00 eV at 1.35\\u2009Vs\\u2009cmâ2 (1/K0). The scan\\nrange for MS and MS/MS spectra was set to 100-1700 m/z. TIMS ramping\\ntime and accumulation time were set to 100 milliseconds. The diaPASEF\\ndata were analyzed by directDIA approach using Spectronaut software\\n(version 14) following manufacture instructions. Up or down regulated\\nproteins were determined using DEP (Differential Enrichment analysis of\\nProteomics data) R package. Significant results (adjusted p-value &lt;\\n0.05) were subjected to Gene Ontology enrichment analysis with\\nclusterProfiler R package.</p>\\n<p><strong>Western Blot</strong></p>\\n<p>Total protein extracts were prepared by lysing cells in extraction\\nbuffer (HEPES KOH [pH 8.5], NaCl 400 mM, EDTA 0.1 mM, EGTA 0.1 mM, DTT 1\\nmM, 1Ã protease inhibitor, SDS 1%). Proteins were separated by\\nelectrophoresis on BOLT 4%â12% bis-tris polyacrylamide precast gels in\\nMES buffer (Life Technologies) and transferred to a 0,2 Î¼m\\nnitrocellulose membrane. Non-specific signals were blocked with 5%\\nMilk-PBS-Tween0.5% and the membrane hybridized overnight at 4Â°C with\\nprimary and secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer. Horseradish\\nperoxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were revealed with the ECL\\nchemiluminescence kit (Amersham), and signals were detected using\\nChemiDoc (Bio-Rad). Primary antibodies: PKR (rabbit, Abcam, ab32052),\\ncGAS (rabbit, Abcam, ab224144), LINE-1 ORF1 (mouse, Merck Millipore,\\nMABC1152), EIF2a (mouse, Abcam, ab5369),\\xa0phospho-EIF2Î±\\xa0(rabbit, Abcam,\\nab32157), Histone H3 (rabbit, Merk, 06-755).</p>\\n<p><strong>Exosome isolation</strong></p>\\n<p>Exosomes were isolated using Total Exosome Isolation Reagent (from\\ncell culture media) (Thermo), following manufacturerâs instructions. The\\nexosome pellet was resuspended in 50 Î¼l of RIPA buffer and kept on ice\\nfor 30â, mixing every 5â. Samples were then sonicated (30ââ ON/30â OFF,\\n10 cycles), centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 20â at 4Â°C and collected as\\nsupernatants.</p>\\n<p><strong>Statistical analysis</strong></p>\\n<p>Statistic tests used for data analysis are indicated in the figure\\nlegends.</p>\\n<p><strong>Data availability</strong></p>\\n<p>The RNA-seq transcriptomics data on human bone biopsies have been\\ndeposited to BioProject with the dataset identifier PRJNA764663\\n(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA764663).

TEs are a major source of endogenous dsRNAs, signaling\\nmolecules able to coordinate inflammatory responses in various\\nphysiological processes. Here, we provide evidence for a positive\\ninvolvement of TEs in inflammation-driven bone repair and\\nmineralization. In newly fractured mice bone, we observed an early\\ntransient upregulation of repeats occurring concurrently with the\\ninitiation of the inflammatory stage. In human bone biopsies, analysis\\nrevealed a significant correlation between repeats expression,\\nmechanical stress and bone mineral density. We investigated a potential\\nlink between LINE-1 (L1) expression and bone mineralization by\\ndelivering a synthetic L1 RNA to osteoporotic patient-derived\\nmesenchymal stem cells and observed a dsRNA-triggered protein kinase\\n(PKR)-mediated stress response that led to strongly increased\\nmineralization.

To\\ninvestigate a possible involvement of TEs in the sterile inflammatory\\nresponse triggered by bone injury, we analyzed TEs expression in\\ntime-course RNA-Seq repository data obtained from a full-fracture bone\\nhealing mice model.(Coates *et al*, 2019) We focused on TEs expression\\ndynamics immediately after fracture (acute inflammatory stage) and\\nobserved four clusters of differentially expressed TEs (logFC \\\\> 0.5)\\nbetween intact and post-fracture bone after 4h, a time point\\ncorresponding to the initiation of acute inflammation (Figure 1A).\\nCluster 1 includes TEs subfamilies whose expression slightly increases\\nafter fracture and during the whole healing process. Clusters 2 and 4\\ninclude TEs subfamilies that are downregulated after fracture but show\\nincreased expression at later time points. The major group, cluster 3,\\nis represented by TEs subfamilies whose expression is highly and\\ntransiently upregulated after fracture (Figure 1A and 1B).\\nInterestingly, the induction of these TEs, mostly Long Interspersed\\nNuclear Elements (LINEs) and Long Terminal Repeats (LTRs) (Figure 1B),\\nis transient and limited to the earliest phase of the inflammatory stage\\nnecessary and sufficient to initiate and orchestrate fracture repair and\\nactivate bone anabolic processes.(Mountziaris *et al*, 2011)^,^(Marsell\\n& Einhorn, 2011) These results suggest that, in bone, retrotransposon\\nreactivation is an early event in response to fracture, possibly linked\\nto inflammation initiation which is fundamental for a healthy healing.\\nIndeed, retrotransposon involvement in posttraumatic tissue regeneration\\nwas previously found in other organisms.(Mashanov *et al*, 2012)^,^(Zhu\\n*et al*, 2012)\\n\\nTo assess gene expression dynamics immediately after fracture in humans\\nrepresents a technical and ethical hurdle. A comparison between bones\\nexperiencing different degrees of mechanical loading may represent an\\nalternative model to study stress-induced bone anabolism in humans.\\nMechanically loaded bones like the femur, which are subject to recurring\\nmicrofractures that need to be repaired, are indicated to be more\\nmetabolically active than less loaded bones, like the iliac crest, as\\npointed out by previous transcriptome studies.(Aerssens *et al*, 1997)\\n(Varanasi *et al*, 2010)\\n\\nWe compared the expression of TEs in trabecular bone from ilium and\\nfemoral head, two different skeletal sites, the latter experiencing a\\nhigher degree of mechanical loading, anabolic demand and bone\\nturnover.(Aerssens *et al*, 1997) Femur (n=48) and ilium biopsies (n=71)\\nwere isolated from a cohort of clinically well-characterized donors\\n(refer to cohort description and Appendix Table S1 and S2). Each cohort\\nwas divided into normal (BMD T-score \\\\>-1), osteopenic (â2.5 \\\\< BMD\\nT-score â¤ â1), and osteoporotic (BMD T-score â¤ â2.5, with at least one\\nfragility fracture). TEs show generally higher upregulation in healthy\\nfemurs (n=27) compared to healthy ilia (n=34) (Figure 1C and 1E). Each\\nTEs order showed a high percentage of upregulated subfamilies, from 60%\\nof DNA transposon to 75% of LINEs, and a low percentage of downregulated\\nsubfamilies, from 9% of LTRs to 3% of Short interspersed nuclear\\nelements (SINEs) and LINEs, in femur compared to ilium (Figure 1D).\\nThese results suggested a positive correlation between TEs global\\nexpression and bone anabolic activity.\\n\\nTo further test our hypothesis, we compared TEs expression in femurs\\nfrom healthy donors (n=27), osteopenic (n=12) and osteoporotic patients\\n(n=9) whose bone anabolism is increasingly compromised. As shown in\\nFigure 2A, the global expression of TEs is reduced in patients. To\\nfurther assess whether TEs expression is involved in local anabolism and\\nassociated with mineral density, we divided the femur cohort according\\nto the DXA T-score measured in the femoral neck (FN). We divided the\\ncohort into \"high BMD\" (FN T-score \\\\>-1) and \"low BMD\" (FN T-score\\n\\\\<-1). Globally, TEs are upregulated in femurs with high bone mineral\\ndensity (Figure 2B). In particular, more than 90% of differentially\\nexpressed TEs subfamilies are upregulated (Figure 2C). Interestingly,\\nalmost all SINE elements are unchanged between the two groups (Figure\\n2C). Finally, we assessed whether a positive correlation exists between\\nTEs expression levels and local mineral density (FN T-score). We found\\nthat approximately 30% of L1 and LTR subfamilies expressed in the\\nfemoral bone are positively correlated with local BMD (Figure 2D).\\nAltogether, these results strongly suggest a positive involvement of TEs\\nin response to stress-induced anabolic demand and bone mineralization.\\n\\n**Increased cytoplasmic L1 repeat RNA stimulates osteoblast\\nmineralization activity**\\n\\nThe *in vivo* evidence suggested a positive involvement of\\nretrotransposons in post-traumatic bone repair in mice, and a strong\\ncorrelation between retrotransposon expression and bone mineral density\\nin humans, and higher expression in loaded compared to unloaded bone. We\\nthen corroborated the results by studying the effects of increasing\\nrepeat RNA levels on differentiating osteoblasts derived from\\nmesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) isolated from femurs of healthy donors. At\\nday 5 of differentiation, a Cy5-conjugated full-length L1 RNA consensus\\nsequence was transfected. Capping, 2\\'-O-Methylation of 5\\' end,\\npolyadenylation (200 adenosines), full substitution with\\n5-methylcytidine (m5C) and 75% substitution with pseudouridine were used\\nto stabilize the RNA and to bypass the intracellular innate immune\\nsystem.(Koski *et al*, 2004) (Pardi *et al*, 2013) (Ludwig *et al*,\\n2010) (KarikÃ³ *et al*, 2005) (Nallagatla & Bevilacqua, 2008) (KarikÃ³ *et\\nal*, 2008) (Anderson *et al*, 2010) (Kormann *et al*, 2011) Red\\nfluorescent protein (RFP) mRNA, with the same modifications, was\\nincluded as negative control. The exogenous L1 RNA accumulated in the\\ncytoplasm (Figure 3A) and was gradually cleared by secretion along with\\nmatrix components (Figure 3B and 3C). The effect of L1 RNA delivery was\\ntested in differentiating MSCs from two different and unrelated healthy\\ndonors. As shown, L1 RNA transfection markedly stimulated the production\\nof mineralized matrix (Figure 3D). Osteoblast mineralization increased\\ndose-dependently with the concentration of the delivered L1 RNA, in\\nagreement with saturation kinetics (Figure 3E). Moreover, the strongly\\nenhanced mineralization was highly specific for L1 RNA, as demonstrated\\nby the lack of significant changes in mineral deposition in cells\\ntransfected with negative control RNA, even at concentrations\\n100-200-fold higher (figure 3E). We also isolated MSCs from the femur of\\nosteoporotic patients and selected those showing a markedly delayed and\\nreduced *in vitro* production of bone matrix in contrast to those\\nderived from healthy donors (Figure 3F). Strikingly, also in these cells\\nwith low osteogenic capacity, the delivery of L1 RNA triggered a strong\\nmineralization response despite their clearly compromised anabolic\\nactivity (Figure 3G). These results demonstrate convincingly that the\\nectopic delivery of L1 RNA stimulates the mineralization of bone-forming\\ncells regardless of their prior intrinsic differentiation/anabolic\\npotential.\\n\\nOsteoporotic patient-derived cells transfected with L1 RNA show a higher\\nexpression of early differentiation markers, with a peak 48h after L1\\ntransfection (day 7) (Figure 3H). Bone sialoprotein (*IBSP*), a late\\nosteogenic gene, shows a similar profile, being almost 6 times more\\nexpressed in L1- than in RFP-transfected cells on day 7 (Appendix Figure\\nS1A). Strikingly, although alkaline phosphatase (*ALPL*) expression\\nslightly increases at later time points (Appendix Figure S1A), its\\nactivity is not enhanced in L1-treated cells (Appendix Figure S2A).\\nHowever, the activity of ectonucleotide\\npyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1) is gradually and\\nsignificantly reduced by L1 RNA transfection (Appendix Figure S2B). As\\nENPP1 is a major source of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), one of the\\nmain physiological inhibitors of mineralization,(FLEISCH *et al*, 1966)\\n(Johnson *et al*, 2000) (Hessle *et al*, 2002) the reduction of its\\nactivity may contribute to the enhanced mineralization observed in\\nL1-RNA transfected cells.\\n\\nAltogether, these data suggest that L1 RNA induces a unique mineralizing\\nphenotype and apparently distinct from the well-known canonical\\ndifferentiation mechanisms.\\n\\n**L1 RNA delivery induces inflammatory pathways significantly\\noverlapping those involved in bone fracture repair**\\n\\nTo investigate the molecular response of osteoblasts to L1 RNA\\ntransfection, we profiled their transcriptome by Illumina RNA-Seq 24h\\npost-transfection. We found 482 differentially expressed genes (DEG)\\n(FDR\\\\<0.05) between L1 and RFP RNA-treated OB (268 upregulated and 214\\ndownregulated) (Appendix Figure S3). Gene ontology (GO) enrichment\\nanalysis revealed that the early transcriptional signature of L1-treated\\nosteoblasts is typical of that of an inflammatory response (Figure 4A\\nand 4B). This is in accordance with the recent evidence of a link\\nbetween L1 and other retrotransposons accumulation in the cytoplasm and\\ninflammatory response *in vitro* and *in vivo*.(Fukuda *et al*, 2021)\\n(De Cecco *et al*, 2019b) (Simon *et al*, 2019) GO term enrichment\\nanalysis comparison between the early stage of fracture-induced bone\\nhealing *in vivo*(Coates *et al*, 2019) and differentiating osteoblasts\\n*in vitro* 24h post-L1 delivery (Figure 4A) revealed a matching\\ninflammatory response and shared upregulated pathways (Figure 4C)\\nessential for effective bone repair.(Maruyama *et al*, 2020)\\n(Gerstenfeld *et al*, 2003) (Kon *et al*, 2001) Recruitment of\\nneutrophils at the site of injury also indicates a healthy repair\\nprocess, particularly in bone.(Kovtun *et al*, 2016) Extracellular\\nsignal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) and 2 (ERK2), play crucial roles in\\nbone formation(Xiao *et al*, 2000) (Xiao *et al*, 2002b) (Xiao *et al*,\\n2002a) (Matsushita *et al*, 2009) (Ge *et al*, 2007) and seem to be the\\nmost upstream initiators of tissue regeneration in planaria.(Owlarn *et\\nal*, 2017) Upon bone injury, an initial transient stage of acute\\ninflammation is a crucial factor in ensuring an effective\\nregeneration(Maruyama *et al*, 2020) whereas an excessive/prolonged\\n(chronic) inflammation is deleterious for the healing environment.(Chan\\n*et al*, 2012) (Hurtgen *et al*, 2016) (Clark *et al*, 2017) (Brem &\\nTomic-Canic, 2007) (Timmen *et al*, 2014) (Schmidt-Bleek *et al*, 2012)\\n(Weckbach *et al*, 2013) We followed the time-course expression of\\n\"inflammatory response\" (GO:0006954) and \"immune response\" (GO:0006955)\\ngenes upregulated by L1 RNA immediately after transfection. As shown in\\nFigure 4D, their expression is already strongly reduced at day 10 and\\nalmost entirely silenced by day 14, suggesting the transient dynamics of\\nthe inflammatory response triggered *in vitro* by L1 RNA. This is\\ncoherent with our previous observation that exogenous L1 RNA is\\ngradually secreted by the cell together with matrix components (Figure\\n3B and C), eventually clearing out the initial inflammatory stimulus.\\n\\n**Cellular response to increased cytoplasmic level of L1 RNA is mediated\\nby PKR**\\n\\nIt has been previously demonstrated that the cytoplasmic accumulation of\\nL1-derived cDNA triggers an inflammatory response mediated by the cyclic\\nGMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) cytosolic\\nDNA sensing pathway.(De Cecco *et al*, 2019a) Immunofluorescence (IF)\\nanalysis reveals that the exogenous L1 RNA forms DNA:RNA hybrids\\n(Appendix Figure S4), suggesting that L1 RNA is reversed transcribed\\ninto cDNA after its transfection. Notably, ORF1p was undetectable by WB\\nin differentiating osteoblasts and in L1 transfected osteoblasts\\n(Appendix Figure S5), indicating that the exogenous L1 RNA is not\\ntranslated after transfection. To assess whether L1-induced inflammation\\nwas triggered by the sensing of its cDNA, we used Lamivudine 3TC and\\nG140 (Figure 5A) to inhibit the ORF2-mediated reverse transcription of\\nL1 RNA and cGAS activity, respectively. Moreover, we also performed a\\nsiRNA-mediated knockdown (KD) of cGAS (Appendix Figure S6). (Jones *et\\nal*, 2008) (Lama *et al*, 2019) Surprisingly, none of the treatments\\nimpaired the mineralization induced by L1 RNA delivery (Figure 5A,\\nAppendix Figure S6C), suggesting that the observed cellular response\\ndepends entirely on RNA sensing. As previously mentioned, repeats are a\\nmajor source of endogenous dsRNA,(Sadeq *et al*, 2021) (Chen & Hur,\\n2022) and L1 RNA, in particular, is able to form intramolecular\\ndouble-stranded structures.(Hur, 2019) As expected, we found a tight\\ncolocalization between L1 RNA and dsRNA IF signal (Figure 5B). One of\\nthe main cellular sensors of dsRNA, including those derived from\\nretrotransposons, is PKR.(Kim *et al*, 2018) PKR activation results in\\nthe phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2Î±\\n(eIF2Î±) and in the subsequent inhibition of global protein synthesis and\\ncell growth.(Donnelly *et al*, 2013) Interestingly, PKR has been shown\\nto interact with L1 RNA *in vitro*.(Kim *et al*, 2018) Moreover, eIF2Î±\\nphosphorylation has been demonstrated to promote autophagy in\\nosteoblasts and to counteract BMD reduction in osteoporotic\\novariectomized mice.(Li *et al*, 2019)\\n\\nTo demonstrate that L1 RNA is able to trigger a PKR-mediated\\nintracellular response, we transfected L1 RNA in the presence or absence\\nof the PKR inhibitor C16 and evaluated the levels of eIF2Î±\\nphosphorylation by western blot (Figure 5C). The delivery of L1, but not\\nRFP, strongly induces eIF2Î± phosphorylation and this effect is prevented\\nby PKR inhibition (Figure 5C). Notably, eIF2Î± phosphorylation occurs\\nalready 6 hours post-transfection. This observation suggests that PKR\\nactivation is one of the first events induced by L1 RNA, thus\\ncorroborating the hypothesis of PKR as an endogenous L1 RNA sensor.\\n\\nWe then characterized the proteome of cells 24h post-L1 RNA transfection\\nby diaPASEF mass spectrometry (MS).(Meier *et al*, 2020a) We detected\\nalmost 8000 proteins in each sample, and observed that more than 88% of\\nsignificantly differentially expressed proteins (DEP) were downregulated\\nin L1-treated cells (Figure 5D, left panel). Moreover, among the top 15\\ndownregulated biological processes and cellular components were\\ntranslation and ribosomal subunits (Figure 5D, right panels, yellow\\ncircles), indicating that L1 RNA induces a global attenuation of protein\\nsynthesis. Indeed, a cap-dependent translation shutdown is the main\\nconsequence of eIF2Î± phosphorylation.(Donnelly *et al*, 2013) Finally,\\nwe show that neither PKR KD (Appendix Figure S6A, B) nor its\\npharmacological inhibition by C16 treatment (Figure 5E and 5F) prevents\\nL1 RNA-triggered induction of inflammatory genes (Figure 5E) and mineral\\nmatrix deposition (Figure 5F, Appendix Figure S6B). As previously\\nmentioned, a global reduction of protein synthesis occurs 24h after L1\\ntransfection and only a little percentage of DEP is upregulated in L1\\ncompared to RFP control (Figure 5D). Interestingly, some of the most\\nupregulated proteins are involved in autophagy and vesicle trafficking\\n(Figure 5G). Autophagy is a crucial process for mineralization and bone\\nhomeostasis both *in vitro* and *in vivo*,(Nollet *et al*, 2014) as\\nautophagic vacuoles are exploited to secrete apatite crystals.\\n\\nAltogether these data demonstrate that the PKR-mediated sensing of\\nL1-derived dsRNA globally attenuates the translation via eIF2Î±\\nphosphorylation and indicate autophagy as a possible mechanism involved\\nin L1-induced osteoblasts mineralization.\\n\\n**L1 RNA delivery reshapes the secretory profile of differentiating\\nosteoblasts**\\n\\nAn inflammatory response translates into a strong secretory activity and\\nproduction of paracrine signals, and we therefore tested the effect of\\n\"L1-primed\" osteoblast-derived conditioned medium in recipient\\ndifferentiating osteoblasts (Figure 6A). We found that the \"secretome\"\\nof cells transfected with L1 RNA has a significant paracrine effect on\\nrecipient osteoblasts since they showed an earlier formation of\\nmineralized nodules, already 24h post the addition of conditioned media\\n(Figure 6A, right panel), and higher deposition of mineral matrix at day\\n10 (Figure 6A, left panel). We subsequently isolated bulk and\\nexosome-derived proteomes from conditioned media of untreated, RFP- and\\nL1-treated differentiating osteoblasts and characterized them by MS.\\nDifferential expression analysis of MS data revealed a unique secretome\\nprofile (for both bulk and vesicular proteomes) of L1-primed osteoblasts\\ncompared to RFP-primed and untreated osteoblasts (Figure 6B). Gene\\nOntology (GO) analysis of differentially expressed proteins showed an\\nenrichment of pro-inflammatory factors (i.e. interleukins and\\nchemokines) involved in immune response and chemotactic migration of\\nimmune cells (Figure 6C and D), crucial processes for tissue repair\\nmechanisms *in vivo*. Pro-inflammatory molecules are also a major\\nconstituent of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype\\n(SASP),(CoppÃ© *et al*, 2010) whose transient delivery supports cellular\\nplasticity and tissue regeneration.(Ritschka *et al*, 2017) Notably, the\\nmost enriched protein in L1-specific bulk secretome is interleukin 8\\n(IL-8), an inflammatory chemokine involved in several regenerative\\nprocesses, such as skin wound healing,(JIANG *et al*, 2012) therapeutic\\nangiogenesis after stroke and ischemia,(Choi *et al*, 2021) (Hou *et\\nal*, 2014) and osteochondral bone repair.(Lin *et al*, 2019) (Yang *et\\nal*, 2018a) Tumor necrosis factor-inducible gene 6 (TSG6) is among the\\ntop 10 proteins enriched in the bulk secretome of L1-primed osteoblasts\\ncompared to RFP. TSG6 is an inflammatory factor with suggestive\\ntherapeutic effects in corneal wounds, myocardial infarction, injured\\ncentral nervous system, chronic liver damage, and intervertebral disc\\ndegeneration.(Zhang *et al*, 2013) (Lee *et al*, 2015) (Lee *et al*,\\n2009) (Wang *et al*, 2017) (Yang *et al*, 2018b) Moreover, TSG6 induces\\nautophagy influx both *in vivo* and *in vitro.*(Wang *et al*, 2017)\\nAnother protein positively involved in autophagy and found specifically\\nin the secretome of L1 primed osteoblasts was ATG7 (autophagy-related\\n7). Osteoblast-specific ATG7 conditional knockout in mice reduced bone\\nmass during developmental and in adult age.(Li *et al*, 2018) Type 1\\nlysophosphatidic acid receptor (LPAR1) is also specifically secreted by\\nL1-primed osteoblasts and has proven to be positively involved in bone\\nmineralization *in vitro* and *in vivo*.(Alioli *et al*, 2020) (Gennero\\n*et al*, 2011)\\n\\nAltogether, our findings demonstrate that cytoplasmic L1 RNA is sensed\\nby PKR, whose activation leads to eIF2Î± phosphorylation with consequent\\nreprogramming of transcription and translation. The ultimate consequence\\nof this L1-induced, PKR-mediated stress response in osteoblasts is a\\nmajor reprogramming of their secretory activity, leading to a paracrine\\neffect on recipient osteogenic competent cells to trigger their\\nmineralization activity.\\n\\n**Discussion**\\n\\nThe concerted co-option of TEs markedly changed whole regulatory\\nnetworks and integrated new functions into the eukaryote genome.(Cosby\\n*et al*, 2019) (Mangiavacchi *et al*, 2021) (Carelli *et al*, 2022)\\nHowever, while the role of TEs as evolutionary drivers is today\\nwell-established, their contribution to cell physiology, particularly in\\nsomatic cells, remains to be elucidated. Indeed, aside from their role\\nin the nucleus, (Della Valle *et al*, 2022) (Jachowicz *et al*, 2017)\\n(Lu *et al*, 2021) (Percharde *et al*, 2018) TEs represent a major\\nsource of endogenous dsRNA whose role in triggering inflammatory and\\ninnate immune responses in various physiological processes has\\nincreasingly gained attention.(Sadeq *et al*, 2021) (Chen & Hur, 2022)\\nFor instance, an early acute inflammatory response is of vital\\nimportance in initiating and orchestrating bone repair and induce\\nanabolism leading to fracture healing. (Mountziaris *et al*, 2011)\\n(Marsell & Einhorn, 2011) (Bahney *et al*, 2019) Moreover, several\\nstudies demonstrated a positive effect of proinflammatory mediators on\\nbone mineralization *in vitro* and *in vivo*,(Croes *et al*, 2015)\\n(Croes *et al*, 2016) (Li *et al*, 2016) (Croes *et al*, 2017)\\nindicating that the modulation of inflammatory reaction is a tool to\\npursue regenerative strategies in bone.(Roberts & Ke, 2018) We found\\nthat, in the bone of newly fractured mice, a group of TEs, mostly LINE\\nand LTR, was early, markedly and transiently upregulated. Interestingly,\\nthe expression of these TEs was limited to the earliest phase of the\\ninflammatory stage. In line with the hypothesis of a positive\\ncorrelation between stress-induced bone mineralization and TEs\\nactivation, the expression dynamics in human bone biopsies revealed a\\nsignificant upregulation of TEs in the femur, a bone subjected to high\\nmechanical stresses, high turnover and anabolism, compared to ilium, not\\nweight bearing. Furthermore, we detected a lower TEs expression in\\ndonors with compromised bone mineralization and a significant\\ncorrelation between TEs expression and local BMD. We hypothesized that\\nthe expression dynamics of TEs in fracture/mechanical stress observed\\n*in vivo* could mimic the immunological threshold model of the sterile\\nactivation of dsRNA sensors as a response to stressful conditions.\\nIndeed, the transient and controlled breaching of the activation\\nthreshold of dsRNA sensors may lead to sterile inflammation being\\nintegrated into physiological processes.(Chen & Hur, 2022) To test\\nfurther this hypothesis, we delivered a full-length L1 consensus\\nsequence as source of dsRNA(Hur, 2019) to differentiating osteoblasts\\n*in vitro* and showed that L1 RNA initially accumulated in the cytoplasm\\nand is gradually cleared by secretion. The increased cytoplasmic levels\\nof L1 RNA are immediately sensed by PKR, a cytoplasmic dsRNA sensor\\nwhose activation induces the phosphorylation of\\neIF2Î±(ÎÎ¹Î¼\\xa0*ÎµÏ\\xa0Î±Î»*,\\xa02018)\\xa0(âÎ¿Î½Î½ÎµÎ»Î»Ï\\xa0*ÎµÏ\\xa0Î±Î»*,\\xa02013), leading to the\\nattenuation of global protein synthesis (Donnelly *et al*, 2013),\\ninduction of inflammatory response, and stimulation of mineral matrix\\ndeposition. In support of the evidence that PKR is the early sensor of\\nincreased L1 RNA cytoplasmic levels, we show that inhibition of PKR\\nactivation by C16 prevents L1-induced eIF2Î±\\xa0phosphorylation, induction\\nof inflammatory genes, and mineral matrix deposition. Moreover, the\\ninhibition of L1 cDNA formation and sensing by Lamivudine 3TC, G140, or\\ncGAS KD does not affect the L1-induced phenotype. Thus, the evidence\\ndoes not support that the L1-triggered inflammation is causally\\nconnected to a cGAS-STING-dependent sensing of cytosolic L1 cDNA, a\\nmechanism demonstrated operative in senescence.(De Cecco *et al*, 2019a)\\n\\nL1 RNA response showed high specificity, as demonstrated by the\\ndose-dependent increase of mineralization and the lack of significant\\nchanges in mineral deposition when negative control RNA was transfected,\\neven at 100-200-fold higher concentration. Although the molecular\\nmechanism behind L1-induced stress response which stimulates the\\nmineralization activity of osteoblasts remains elusive, our results\\nindicate that L1 stimulates the mineral matrix deposition by\\nbone-forming cells regardless of their prior intrinsic anabolic\\npotential. Moreover, MS results suggested that increased autophagy, a\\nprocess crucial for mineralization and bone homeostasis *in vitro* and\\n*in vivo*(Nollet *et al*, 2014) may contribute to L1-induced\\nhydroxyapatite deposition. Intriguingly, the osteoinductive properties\\nof L1-primed osteoblast-derived secretome and the observation that L1\\nRNA was gradually secreted by the cells may suggest an involvement of L1\\nRNA in cell-to-cell communication, in line with the recent finding of\\nother retrotransposons (i.e. ERV) acting as paracrine molecules.(Liu *et\\nal*, 2021) This, together with the observed L1-dependent induction of\\nCCL and CXCL chemokines and cytokines, being chemoattractants of immune\\ncells and endothelial cells,(Bischoff *et al*, 2011) (Eash *et al*,\\n2010) (Strieter *et al*, 2005) and the composition of L1-primed\\nosteoblast secretome, makes the *in vivo* delivery of L1 RNA a necessary\\nstep to evaluate its actual contribution to the paracrine processes that\\norchestrate bone repair mechanisms. (Chaparro & Linero, 2016)\\n(Nimiritsky *et al*, 2019)\\n\\nThe identification of repeats RNA, particularly L1, as potential\\nresilient molecular factors involved in stress-induced,\\ninflammation-mediated bone production points out new avenues to develop\\nanabolic strategies for the treatment of bone loss conditions, such as\\nosteoporosis or impaired bone repair.(Roberts & Ke, 2018) On the other\\nhand, repeats may be novel targets in the treatment of those conditions\\ncharacterized by excessive or heterotopic ossification preceded by\\nderegulated/chronic inflammation.(Lories & Schett, 2012) (Balboni *et\\nal*, 2006)\\n\\n**Materials and Methods**\\n\\n**Participants and ethics**\\n\\nFemoral bone biopsies were obtained from the caput region of\\npostmenopausal women or men with a wide BMD range, i.e., from healthy to\\nosteoporotic, who were undergoing hip replacement surgery due to\\nosteoarthritis or fracture at Lovisenberg Diaconal Hospital (Oslo,\\nNorway) or Diakonhiemmet Hospital (Oslo, Norway), respectively. The\\ndonors of femoral bones are listed in Appendix Table S1. The\\npostmenopausal iliac bone donors were recruited from the outpatient\\nclinic of Lovisenberg Diaconal Hospital (Oslo, Norway). Candidates\\nfilled out a questionnaire that included medication and lifestyle\\nfactors, and selected donors were deemed representative of the\\nOslo-based Norwegian ethnic female population aged 50 to 86\\u2009years. The\\niliac bone donors are listed in Appendix Table S2 and have been\\ndescribed previously in detail.(Reppe *et al*, 2010) All donors taking\\nmedication or having diseases, other than primary osteoporosis, known to\\naffect bone metabolism were excluded. The presence of bone-impairing\\ndiseases/conditions was excluded by extensive biochemical serum and\\nurine analyses supported by X-ray examinations. The site-specific BMD of\\nall donors was evaluated with Lunar Prodigy DEXA (GE Lunar, Madison, WI,\\nUSA) following the manufacturer\\\\\\'s instructions. The precision of the\\ninstrument for measuring the lumbar spine (L~2~--L~4~) and hip BMD was\\n1.7% and 1.1%, respectively. The study was approved by the Norwegian\\nRegional Ethical Committee (REK no 2010/2539, Norway), all volunteers\\ngave their written informed consent, and sampling and procedures were\\naccording to the Act of Biobanking in Norway.\\n\\n**Cell culture**\\n\\nFor L1 RNA transfection experiments, human MSCs were isolated from\\nosteoporotic femoral heads with the consent of the patient according to\\nSwiss (BASEC-Nr. 2016-02159) ethical guidelines. Femoral heads were\\ncrushed and incubated in DMEM (PAN Biotech, Germany, Cat. No. P04-03550)\\nsupplemented with 1% (v/v) 100Ã Penicillin-Streptomycin Solution\\n(Biowest, France, Cat.

No. F0291) and 10ng/ml FGF-4\\n(Sigma, USA, Cat. No. F8424) in a humidified atmosphere containing 5%\\nCO2. To induce osteogenic differentiation, MSCs were seeded on Nuncâ¢\\n24-well plates (Thermo Fisher, USA, Cat. No. 142475) or 48-well plates\\n(Thermo Fisher, USA, Cat. No. 150687) at a density of 1.5\\u2009Ã\\u200910^4^\\ncells/cm2. After 24\\u2009h, differentiation was induced using StemProÂ®\\nOsteogenesis Kit (Gibco/Life Technologies, USA, Cat. No. A10072-01). The\\nmedium was exchanged every 3 days. Cells were treated with Lamivudine\\n3TC (Sigma), 1Î¼M final concentration; C16 (Merck), 500nM final\\nconcentration; G140 (InvivoGen), 150Î¼M final concentration.\\n\\n**L1 RNA transfection**\\n\\nThe vector human-L1_pBluescript II sk (+) carrying the full-length L1\\nsequence was custom-prepared by GenScript, USA. Large-scale human L1\\nmRNA was in vitro transcribed, modified, and purified by TriLink\\nBiotechnologies, USA, (ARCA capped and 2\\'Omethymalted (CapI), fully\\nsubstituted with 5-methyl-C, 25% substitution of Cyanine-5-U and 75%\\nsubstitution of Pseudo-U, enzymatically polyadenylated, DNase and\\nphosphatase treated, silica membrane purified). Synthetic L1 RNA was\\ntransfected in MSCs differentiating to osteoblasts at day 5 using\\nLipofectamine^TM^ MessengerMAX^TM^ (Invitrogen, USA, Cat. No. LMRNA003)\\nwith a modified protocol for low RNA amount. RFP mRNA (System\\nBioscience, USA, Cat. No. MR800A-1) was used as negative control. Bone\\nmatrix was quantified with OsteoImage Mineralization Assay (Lonza,\\nBasel, Switzerland, Cat. No. LOPA503) and Alizarin Red staining. In\\nconditioned media experiments, the medium was exchanged 6h after\\ntransfection. Conditioned medium was collected after three days and\\ndelivered to the recipient, differentiating osteoblasts at day 5. In\\nknockdown experiments, siRNAs were transfected with Lipofectamine\\nRNAiMAX (Thermo Scientific) in differentiating osteoblasts at day 3,\\nfollowed by L1 RNA transfection at day 7. siRNAs: EIF2AK2- Targeting\\nSMARTpool (Dharmacon, Horizon, E-003527-00-0010), MB21D1-Targeting\\nSMARTpool (Dharmacon, Horizon, L-015607-02-0020), Non-targeting Pool\\n(D-001810-10).\\n\\n**Quantitative mineralization assay**\\n\\nCells were washed in PBS and fixed in 4% (v/v) formaldehyde (Sigma, USA,\\nCat. No. F8775) in 1Ã PBS for 15 minutes. Mineralization was assessed by\\nusing the OsteoImage Mineralization Assay (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland,\\nCat. No. LOPA503) according to the manufacturer\\'s indication.\\nMineralization was quantified with GloMaxÂ® discover microplate reader\\n(Promega, USA), selecting appropriate excitation (492) / emission (520)\\nwavelengths.\\n\\n**Alizarin Red staining**\\n\\nOsteoblasts were washed with 1Ã PBS (Kantonsapotheke ZÃ¼rich,\\nSwitzerland, Cat. No. A171012) and fixed with 4% (v/v) formaldehyde\\n(Sigma, USA, Cat. No. F8775) in 1Ã PBS for 30\\u2009min. After washing twice\\nwith ddH2O, Alizarin Red staining solution (0.7\\u2009g Alizarin Red S (Sigma,\\nUSA, Cat. No. A5533) diluted in 50\\u2009ml ddH2O at pH\\u2009=\\u20094.2) was added for\\n20\\u2009min. Afterwards, cells were washed four times with ddH2O, dried, and\\nstored in the dark until image acquisition. For absorbance measurement,\\nAlizarin Red S was eluted from stained osteoblasts with 300\\u2009Î¼l 10% (w/v)\\ncetylpyridinium chloride in an aqueous 0.01\\u2009M Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 solution\\nat pH\\u2009=\\u20097 for 1\\u2009h. One hundred fifty microliters were transferred on a\\n96-well plate, and absorbance was measured at 560\\u2009nm. Ten percent (w/v)\\ncetylpyridinium chloride in an aqueous 0.01\\u2009M Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 solution\\nwas used as blank. Images were acquired, processed and analysed as\\npreviously described(Eggerschwiler *et al*, 2019)\\n\\n**ALPL activity assay:**\\n\\nALPL activity was measured as in Liu et al., 2016.(Liu *et al*, 2016)\\nBriefly, cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde at RT for 10\\' and then\\nstained with a solution of 25% naphthol AS-BI phosphate (Thermo) and\\n0.75% Fast Blue BB (Sigma) dissolved in 0.1\\u2009M Tris buffer (pH 9.3) at RT\\nfor 15\\'. After staining, cells were quickly washed with PBS five times.\\n\\n**ENPP1 activity assay**\\n\\nENPP1 activity was calculated colorimetrically using the chromogenic\\nsubstrate p-nitrophenyl-thymidine-5â²-monophosphate, as described in\\n(Ferreira et al., 2013). After PBS washing, cells were lysed in a\\nsolution of 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 M Tris-base, 1.6 mM MgCl2, pH 8.1. 50\\nÎ¼l of 1mM thymidine monophosphate p-nitrophenyl ester (Sigma) were added\\nto 50 Î¼l of cell lysate and incubated for 1 hour at 37Â°C. Then, four\\nvolumes of 0.1M NaOH were added to stop the reaction and absorbance was\\nread at 410 nm using a spectrophotometer (Tecan Nanoquant Infinite 200\\nPro Multimode). Absorbance was normalized to DNA content.\\n\\n**Immunohistochemistry:**\\n\\nCells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature (RT)\\nfor 10\\'. After fixation, cells were permeabilized in 3% Triton X-100 in\\nPBS for 3\\' at RT. Blocking was performed with 4% BSA in PBS for 30\\' at\\nRT. After blocking, cells were incubated with primary antibodies\\novernight at 4Â°C, then washed with PBS and incubated with secondary\\nantibodies for 1 hour at RT. After washing with PBS, nuclei were stained\\nwith Hoechst (Thermo Scientific) and mounted using Fluoro Gel with\\nDABCOâ¢ Mounting Medium (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Primary\\nantibodies: DNA-RNA Hybrid (mouse, Merck Millipore, MABE1095), dsRNA\\n(mouse, Merck Millipore, MABE1134).\\n\\n**RNA extraction and cDNA preparation**\\n\\nCells were harvested and resuspended in 1ml of QIAzol Lysis reagent\\n(Qiagen, Cat. No.79306). Total RNA was then purified with RNeasy Plus\\nMini kit (Qiagen, cat. No. 74134) with minimal modifications to\\nmanufacturer\\'s instructions. DNase treatment (RNase-free DNase set,\\nQiagen, Cat. No. 79254) was performed to remove any residual DNA. RNA\\nquality and concentration were checked using a Nanodrop^TM^ 2000\\nspectrophotometer (ThermoFisher). cDNA was synthesized from 200ng of\\neach RNA sample using a Superscript III first-strand cDNA synthesis\\nsystem (ThermoFisher, cat. No.18080051) according to the manufacturer\\'s\\nprotocol. Processing of human bone biopsies and RNA isolation has been\\ndescribed previously.(Reppe *et al*, 2010)\\n\\n**Gene expression analysis**\\n\\nReal-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed\\nwith a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Each\\nsample was analyzed in triplicate and normalized with the endogenous\\ncontrol Ribosomal Protein L13A (*RPL13A)* for cDNA input concentration.\\nNo template and no RT were included as negative controls. For each 15Î¼l\\nreaction, 10ng (1ng for L1) of cDNA was mixed with 1Î¼M specific primers\\nmix and 7.5Î¼l of Sybr^TM^ Select Master mix (Applied Biosystems, USA,\\nCat. No. 4472908). The reaction was incubated at 95Â°C for 10 minutes,\\nfollowed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95Â°C for 15 seconds, annealing\\nat 60Â°C for 30 seconds and elongation at 72Â°C for 30 seconds. Ct values\\nwere calculated by 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR RQ manager software\\n(Applied Biosystems, USA) and then normalized as âCt between the gene of\\ninterest and the endogenous calibrator. Primers used in this study for\\ngene expression analysis were designed using Primer3\\n([[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/)).\\nIn all primer pairs, each primer matches a different exon. Amplicons\\nlength was 80-130 nucleotides. Primer sequences are reported in Appendix\\nTable S3.\\n\\n**Cell cycle analysis**\\n\\n2x10^5^ MSCs were trypsinized for 5 min at 37Â°C, washed with PBS and 2%\\nBSA, passed through a 70Î¼M strainer (Corning, USA, Cat. No. 352350) and\\nthen fixed at -20Â°C for 30 min in 70% ethanol. After washing with PBS\\nand 4% BSA, cells were resuspended in PBS and incubated for 1 hour at\\n37Â°C with RNase. Cells were then washed and resuspended in 100Î¼l of Flow\\nCytometry Staining Buffer (R&D System, USA, Cat. No. FC001). 10Î¼l of\\n1mg/ml Propidium iodide (PI) staining solution (Invitrogen, USA, Cat.\\nNo. P3566) was added to the single-cell solution, gently mixed, and\\nincubated for 5 min in the dark. Cell cycle analysis was performed on BD\\nFACSCanto II Flow Cytometry System (BD-Biosciences), using BD FACSDiva\\nSoftware (BD-Biosciences).\\n\\n**RNA-Seq and data analysis**\\n\\nRNA from human bone biopsies was sequenced at the Human Genotyping\\nfacility (HuGe-F) of Erasmus MC.\\n\\nTotal RNA-Seq library, from L1 RNA delivery experiments, was prepared\\nwith CORALL Total RNA library prep with RiboCop rRNA for Human/Mouse/Rat\\ndepletion kit (Lexogen GmbH, Vienna, Austria) following manufacturer\\'s\\ninstructions (library type: fr-secondstrand) by IGA Technology service\\n(Italy). The final libraries were checked using both Qubit 2.0\\nFluorometer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and Agilent Bioanalyzer DNA assay\\nor Caliper (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). Libraries were then prepared for\\nsequencing and sequenced on paired-end 150 bp mode on NovaSeq6000\\n(Illumina, San Diego, CA). RNA-Seq read quality control (QC) analyses\\nand filtering of high-quality reads were executed using FastQC v0.11.9\\n(http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) and BBDuk\\nv35.85\\n([https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/software-tools/bbtools/bb-tools-user-guide/bbduk-guide/](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/software-tools/bbtools/bb-tools-user-guide/bbduk-guide/__;!!Nmw4Hv0!0EikfGZVN-B-Xp5VkKLqowTItYk7Yav6lOsagjvuQwPqWY_Y3yszwKePkxm4puTKivdPL5LvCMjrSQwcKpyz9m7YVqqz09ekvfk$))\\xa0by\\nsetting a minimum read length of 35 bp and a minimum Phred-quality score\\nof 25. After trimming quality control, high-quality reads were aligned\\nto the human genome reference (GRCh38) with STAR 2.7.3a,(Dobin *et al*,\\n2013) while FeatureCounts 1.6.3 package(Liao *et al*, 2014) was used to\\nassign reads to genes. Next, lowly expressed genes across one or more\\nexperimental conditions were filtered to eliminate the \"uninformative\"\\ngenes using HTSFilter v1.30.1.(Rau *et al*, 2013) Filtered gene data\\nwere further processed with the EdgeR package v3.32.1(Robinson *et al*,\\n2010) to normalize (Trimmed Mean of M-7 values, TMM, method) the raw\\ncounts and perform differential gene expression analysis. Multiple\\ntesting correction was performed with the FDR method(Benjamini &\\nHochberg, 1995) and significance level was set at FDR \\\\< 0.05. Gene\\nOntology (GO) term enrichment was analyzed by performing hypergeometric\\ntests11 for each individual term, and FDR correction was applied (FDR \\\\<\\n0.05). Expression of Interspersed Repeat elements was quantified using\\nSQuiRE 0.9.9.92 (https://github.com/wyang17/SquIRE). SQuiRE provides\\nlocus-specific expression quantification along with subfamily-level\\nexpression estimates counting unambiguously mapped reads, as well as\\nambiguously mapped reads using an expectation--maximization (EM)\\nalgorithm.(Yang *et al*, 2019) Briefly, reference genome and\\nRepeatmasker annotation were downloaded from UCSC and prepared for the\\nanalysis with squire Fetch and squire Clean, respectively. High-quality\\nreads were mapped against the reference genome with STAR using squire\\nMap and expression was quantified using squire Call. Differential\\nexpression analysis was performed with squire Call.\\n\\n**DIA-MS analysis using TimsTOF MS**\\n\\nTotal protein extracts were prepared with RIPA buffer (50mMTris-cl pH\\n8.0, 5mM EDTA, 150mM Nacl, 15mM MgCl~2~, 1% NP-40, 1mM PMSF and 1X\\nProtease Inhibitor Cocktail (PIC)). Further sonication step was\\nincluded: (30S ON, 30S OFF, 10 cycles with Bioruptor). Equal 50 Î¼g\\nprotein extracts were concentrated to 30 Î¼l volume, then diluted in 8M\\nurea in 0.1M Tris-HCl, followed by protein digestion with trypsin,\\naccording to the FASP protocol.(WiÅniewski *et al*, 2009) After\\novernight digestion, the peptides were eluted from the filters with 25\\nmM ammonium bicarbonate buffer. The eluted peptides were processed in\\nthe desalting step using Sep-Pag C18 Column (waters) based on the\\nmanufacturer\\'s instructions. Approximately 200 ng of peptide mixture per\\nsample was analyzed using a timsTOF Pro 2 QTOF mass spectrometer coupled\\nwith a nanoElute liquid chromatography system (Bruker Daltonik GmbH,\\nGermany). The sample was injected directly into an RP-C18 Aurora emitter\\ncolumn (75 Âµm\\u202fi.d.Ã\\u202f250 mm, 1.6 Î¼m, 120 Ã pore size) (Ion Opticks,\\nAustralia) using a one-column separation method. An 80-min gradient was\\nestablished using mobile phase A (0.1% FA in H2O) and mobile phase B\\n(0.1% FA in Acetonitrile): 2--25% B for 60\\u2009min, 25--37% for 10\\u2009min,\\nramping 37% to 95% in 5\\u2009min, and maintaining 95% B for 5\\u2009min. The column\\ntemperature was set at 50^o^C and the flow rate at 250 nl/min. The\\nsample eluting from the separation column was introduced into the mass\\nspectrometer via a CaptiveSpray nano-electrospray ion source (Bruker\\nDaltonik GmbH) with an electrospray voltage of 1.6\\u2009kV. The ion source\\ntemperature was set to 180\\u2009Â°C and a dry gas of 3 l/min. The samples were\\nanalyzed using diaPASEF scheme(Meier *et al*, 2020b) consisting of 24\\ncycles including a total of 48 mass width windows (13 Da (m/z) from m/z\\n400 to 1,000 and TIMS scan range from\\u20090.63\\u2009to 1.35\\u2009Vs\\u2009cmâ2 (1/K0). The\\ncollisional energy increased linearly from 20.01 eV at 0.6 (1/K0) to\\n52.00 eV at 1.35\\u2009Vs\\u2009cmâ2 (1/K0). The scan range for MS and MS/MS spectra\\nwas set to 100-1700 m/z. TIMS ramping time and accumulation time were\\nset to 100 milliseconds. The diaPASEF data were analyzed by directDIA\\napproach using Spectronaut software (version 14) following manufacture\\ninstructions. Up or down regulated proteins were determined using DEP\\n(Differential Enrichment analysis of Proteomics data) R package.\\nSignificant results (adjusted p-value \\\\< 0.05) were subjected to Gene\\nOntology enrichment analysis with clusterProfiler R package.\\n\\n**Western Blot**\\n\\nTotal protein extracts were prepared by lysing cells in extraction\\nbuffer (HEPES KOH \\\\[pH 8.5\\\\], NaCl 400 mM, EDTA 0.1 mM, EGTA 0.1 mM, DTT\\n1 mM, 1Ã protease inhibitor, SDS 1%). Proteins were separated by\\nelectrophoresis on BOLT 4%--12% bis-tris polyacrylamide precast gels in\\nMES buffer (Life Technologies) and transferred to a 0,2 Î¼m\\nnitrocellulose membrane. Non-specific signals were blocked with 5%\\nMilk-PBS-Tween0.5% and the membrane hybridized overnight at 4Â°C with\\nprimary and secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer. Horseradish\\nperoxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were revealed with the ECL\\nchemiluminescence kit (Amersham), and signals were detected using\\nChemiDoc (Bio-Rad). Primary antibodies: PKR (rabbit, Abcam, ab32052),\\ncGAS (rabbit, Abcam, ab224144), LINE-1 ORF1 (mouse, Merck Millipore,\\nMABC1152), EIF2a (mouse, Abcam, ab5369),\\xa0phospho-EIF2Î±\\xa0(rabbit, Abcam,\\nab32157), Histone H3 (rabbit, Merk, 06-755).\\n\\n**Exosome isolation**\\n\\nExosomes were isolated using Total Exosome Isolation Reagent (from cell\\nculture media) (Thermo), following manufacturer\\'s instructions. The\\nexosome pellet was resuspended in 50 Î¼l of RIPA buffer and kept on ice\\nfor 30\\', mixing every 5\\'.

TEs are a major source of endogenous dsRNAs, signaling molecules\\n\\nable to coordinate inflammatory responses in various physiological processes. Here, we provide evidence for a\\n\\npositive involvement of TEs in inflammation-driven bone repair and mineralization. In newly fractured mice bone,\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nwe observed an early transient upregulation of repeats occurring concurrently with the initiation of the inflammatory\\n\\nstage. In human bone biopsies, analysis revealed a significant correlation between repeats expression, mechanical\\n\\nstress and bone mineral density. We investigated a potential link between LINE-1 (L1) expression and bone\\n\\nmineralization by delivering a synthetic L1 RNA to osteoporotic patient-derived mesenchymal stem cells and\\n\\nobserved a dsRNA-triggered protein kinase (PKR)-mediated stress response that led to strongly increased\\n\\nmineralization. This response was associated with a strong and transient inflammation, accompanied by a global\\n\\ntranslation attenuation induced by eIF2\\uf061 phosphorylation. We demonstrated that L1 transfection reshaped the\\n\\nsecretory profile of osteoblasts, triggering a paracrine activity that stimulated the mineralization of recipient cells.\\n\\nKeywords: dsRNA/inflammation/osteoblast /PKR/transposable elements\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nRepetitive elements are, in origin, parasitic transposable elements (TEs) of viral derivation and during evolution\\n\\nhave become regulatory modules of gene expression, eventually integrated into developmental, resilience, and cell\\n\\nidentity programs.(Cosby et al, 2019) (Mangiavacchi et al, 2021) (Jachowicz et al, 2017) Although cells have\\n\\nevolved several defense mechanisms to prevent deleterious uncontrolled retrotransposon reactivation,(Slotkin &\\n\\nMartienssen, 2007) increasing evidence demonstrates that retrotransposons are also involved in non-pathological\\n\\ncontexts, particularly as non-coding RNAs.(Mangiavacchi et al, 2021) As part of resilience mechanisms, all\\n\\nretrotransposons are a major source of endogenous double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), that serve as a cellular\\n\\nsignaling molecule to coordinate inflammatory and immune responses in various physiological processes.(Fukuda et\\n\\nal, 2021) (De Cecco et al, 2019a) (Simon et al, 2019) (Sadeq et al, 2021) (Chen & Hur, 2022) (Zhang et al, 2020)\\n\\nThe transient and controlled breaching of the activation threshold of dsRNA sensors allows the integration of innate\\n\\nimmune functions within the frame of physiological processes.(Chen & Hur, 2022) For example, repetitive elements\\n\\ntranscribed during development drive RIG-I-like receptors (RLR)-mediated inflammatory signals that regulate\\n\\nhematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) formation.(Lefkopoulos et al, 2020) During cell replication,\\n\\ndsRNA-mediated activation of PKR ensures proper progression of mitosis.(Kim et al, 2014) Moreover,\\n\\nepigenetically mediated derepression of repetitive elements leads to dsRNA production and to the activation of an\\n\\ninflammatory response stimulating anti-tumor T cell immunity.(Sheng et al, 2018) Furthermore, after skin injury,\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\ndsRNAs induce inflammatory pathways contributing to wound healing and hair regeneration.(Nelson et al, 2015)\\n\\nSeveral studies have demonstrated a positive effect of proinflammatory mediators on bone anabolism in vitro and in\\n\\nvivo,(Croes et al, 2015) (Croes et al, 2016) (Li et al, 2016) (Croes et al, 2017) (Laroche et al, 2011) suggesting that\\n\\nan inflammatory reaction may be harnessed for bone regenerative purposes. Indeed, sterile inflammation is a\\n\\nfundamental component of the osteogenic microenvironment: the inflammatory reaction is the earliest response to\\n\\ninjury and is crucial to initiate and orchestrate fracture repair and activate bone anabolic processes. (Mountziaris et\\n\\nal, 2011) (Marsell & Einhorn, 2011) (Bahney et al, 2019) Accordingly, a dysregulated inflammation negatively\\n\\nimpacts optimal bone regeneration, (Wheatley et al, 2019) (Gerstenfeld et al, 2001) (Recknagel et al, 2013)\\n\\n(Hurtgen et al, 2016) (Jiao et al, 2015) and often precedes the excessive bone formation associated with heterotopic\\n\\nossification and several vertebral column pathological conditions. (Lories & Schett, 2012) (Balboni et al, 2006)\\n\\nTherefore, identifying the key molecular factors triggering the sterile inflammation that precedes regeneration in\\n\\nbone would allow us to modulate the inflammatory reaction in a spatiotemporal and contextual manner as well as to\\n\\ndevelop new anabolic strategies for the treatment of bone loss conditions, such as osteoporosis, or impaired bone\\n\\nrepair.(Roberts & Ke, 2018)\\n\\nHere, we show that 1) In mice, immediately after bone fracture, a transient upregulation of TEs concurs with the\\n\\ninitiation of the inflammatory stage; 2) in humans, an increased expression of repeats is observed in bones with a\\n\\nhigher mechanical stress-induced anabolic demand and expression of TEs correlates with local mineral density; 3)\\n\\nThe delivery of L1 RNA, but not control RNA, to human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells committed\\n\\nto osteoblasts stimulates a unique mineralizing phenotype in a dose-dependent manner; 4) L1-treated osteoblasts\\n\\nshow upregulation of inflammatory genes and transcriptional changes characteristic for the earliest stage of bone\\n\\nrepair; 5) cytoplasmic L1 RNA is sensed by dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR), which mediates eIF2Î±\\n\\nphosphorylation and a global attenuation of protein synthesis; 6) the inhibition of PKR prevents inflammation,\\n\\ninhibits translation and induces mineralization caused by elevated levels of cytoplasmic L1 RNA; 7) cells\\n\\ntransfected with L1 RNA undergo significant changes in their secretome composition and initiate a paracrine effect\\n\\nstimulating the mineralization of osteogenic competent recipient cells.\\n\\nOur results indicate that TEs are induced by bone damage and stimulate bone mineralization through an\\n\\ninflammatory response triggered by dsRNA sensing and mediated by a paracrine activity.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n# Results\\n\\nRetrotransposon expression is triggered by fracture in vivo and correlates with bone mineral density in\\n\\nhuman weight-bearing bones\\n\\nInflammation is the earliest response in fracture healing. To investigate a possible involvement of TEs in the sterile\\n\\ninflammatory response triggered by bone injury, we analyzed TEs expression in time-course RNA-Seq repository\\n\\ndata obtained from a full-fracture bone healing mice model.(Coates et al, 2019) We focused on TEs expression\\n\\ndynamics immediately after fracture (acute inflammatory stage) and observed four clusters of differentially\\n\\nexpressed TEs (logFC > 0.5) between intact and post-fracture bone after 4h, a time point corresponding to the\\n\\ninitiation of acute inflammation (Figure 1A). Cluster 1 includes TEs subfamilies whose expression slightly increases\\n\\nafter fracture and during the whole healing process. Clusters 2 and 4 include TEs subfamilies that are downregulated\\n\\nafter fracture but show increased expression at later time points. The major group, cluster 3, is represented by TEs\\n\\nsubfamilies whose expression is highly and transiently upregulated after fracture (Figure 1A and 1B). Interestingly,\\n\\nthe induction of these TEs, mostly Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements (LINEs) and Long Terminal Repeats (LTRs)\\n\\n(Figure 1B), is transient and limited to the earliest phase of the inflammatory stage necessary and sufficient to\\n\\ninitiate and orchestrate fracture repair and activate bone anabolic processes.(Mountziaris et al, 2011)[,](Marsell &\\n\\nEinhorn, 2011) These results suggest that, in bone, retrotransposon reactivation is an early event in response to\\n\\nfracture, possibly linked to inflammation initiation which is fundamental for a healthy healing. Indeed,\\n\\nretrotransposon involvement in posttraumatic tissue regeneration was previously found in other organisms.\\n\\n(Mashanov et al, 2012)[,](Zhu et al, 2012)\\n\\nTo assess gene expression dynamics immediately after fracture in humans represents a technical and ethical hurdle.\\n\\nA comparison between bones experiencing different degrees of mechanical loading may represent an alternative\\n\\nmodel to study stress-induced bone anabolism in humans. Mechanically loaded bones like the femur, which are\\n\\nsubject to recurring microfractures that need to be repaired, are indicated to be more metabolically active than less\\n\\nloaded bones, like the iliac crest, as pointed out by previous transcriptome studies.(Aerssens et al, 1997) (Varanasi et\\n\\nal, 2010)\\n\\nWe compared the expression of TEs in trabecular bone from ilium and femoral head, two different skeletal sites, the\\n\\nlatter experiencing a higher degree of mechanical loading, anabolic demand and bone turnover.(Aerssens et al,\\n\\n1997) Femur (n=48) and ilium biopsies (n=71) were isolated from a cohort of clinically well-characterized donors\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n(refer to cohort description and Appendix Table S1 and S2). Each cohort was divided into normal (BMD T-score >\\n1), osteopenic (â2.5 < BMD T-score â¤ â1), and osteoporotic (BMD T-score â¤ â2.5, with at least one fragility\\n\\nfracture). TEs show generally higher upregulation in healthy femurs (n=27) compared to healthy ilia (n=34) (Figure\\n\\n1C and 1E). Each TEs order showed a high percentage of upregulated subfamilies, from 60% of DNA transposon to\\n\\n75% of LINEs, and a low percentage of downregulated subfamilies, from 9% of LTRs to 3% of Short interspersed\\n\\nnuclear elements (SINEs) and LINEs, in femur compared to ilium (Figure 1D). These results suggested a positive\\n\\ncorrelation between TEs global expression and bone anabolic activity.\\n\\nTo further test our hypothesis, we compared TEs expression in femurs from healthy donors (n=27), osteopenic\\n\\n(n=12) and osteoporotic patients (n=9) whose bone anabolism is increasingly compromised. As shown in Figure 2A,\\n\\nthe global expression of TEs is reduced in patients. To further assess whether TEs expression is involved in local\\n\\nanabolism and associated with mineral density, we divided the femur cohort according to the DXA T-score measured\\n\\nin the femoral neck (FN). We divided the cohort into âhigh BMDâ (FN T-score >-1) and âlow BMDâ (FN T-score <\\n1). Globally, TEs are upregulated in femurs with high bone mineral density (Figure 2B). In particular, more than\\n\\n90% of differentially expressed TEs subfamilies are upregulated (Figure 2C). Interestingly, almost all SINE\\n\\nelements are unchanged between the two groups (Figure 2C). Finally, we assessed whether a positive correlation\\n\\nexists between TEs expression levels and local mineral density (FN T-score). We found that approximately 30% of\\n\\nL1 and LTR subfamilies expressed in the femoral bone are positively correlated with local BMD (Figure 2D).\\n\\nAltogether, these results strongly suggest a positive involvement of TEs in response to stress-induced anabolic\\n\\ndemand and bone mineralization.\\n\\nIncreased cytoplasmic L1 repeat RNA stimulates osteoblast mineralization activity\\n\\nThe in vivo evidence suggested a positive involvement of retrotransposons in post-traumatic bone repair in mice, and\\n\\na strong correlation between retrotransposon expression and bone mineral density in humans, and higher expression\\n\\nin loaded compared to unloaded bone. We then corroborated the results by studying the effects of increasing repeat\\n\\nRNA levels on differentiating osteoblasts derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) isolated from femurs of\\n\\nhealthy donors. At day 5 of differentiation, a Cy5-conjugated full-length L1 RNA consensus sequence was\\n\\ntransfected. Capping, 2â-O-Methylation of 5â end, polyadenylation (200 adenosines), full substitution with 5\\nmethylcytidine (m5C) and 75% substitution with pseudouridine were used to stabilize the RNA and to bypass the\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nintracellular innate immune system.(Koski et al, 2004) (Pardi et al, 2013) (Ludwig et al, 2010) (KarikÃ³ et al, 2005)\\n\\n(Nallagatla & Bevilacqua, 2008) (KarikÃ³ et al, 2008) (Anderson et al, 2010) (Kormann et al, 2011) Red fluorescent\\n\\nprotein (RFP) mRNA, with the same modifications, was included as negative control. The exogenous L1 RNA\\n\\naccumulated in the cytoplasm (Figure 3A) and was gradually cleared by secretion along with matrix components\\n\\n(Figure 3B and 3C). The effect of L1 RNA delivery was tested in differentiating MSCs from two different and\\n\\nunrelated healthy donors. As shown, L1 RNA transfection markedly stimulated the production of mineralized matrix\\n\\n(Figure 3D). Osteoblast mineralization increased dose-dependently with the concentration of the delivered L1 RNA,\\n\\nin agreement with saturation kinetics (Figure 3E). Moreover, the strongly enhanced mineralization was highly\\n\\nspecific for L1 RNA, as demonstrated by the lack of significant changes in mineral deposition in cells transfected\\n\\nwith negative control RNA, even at concentrations 100-200-fold higher (figure 3E). We also isolated MSCs from the\\n\\nfemur of osteoporotic patients and selected those showing a markedly delayed and reduced in vitro production of\\n\\nbone matrix in contrast to those derived from healthy donors (Figure 3F). Strikingly, also in these cells with low\\n\\nosteogenic capacity, the delivery of L1 RNA triggered a strong mineralization response despite their clearly\\n\\ncompromised anabolic activity (Figure 3G). These results demonstrate convincingly that the ectopic delivery of L1\\n\\nRNA stimulates the mineralization of bone-forming cells regardless of their prior intrinsic differentiation/anabolic\\n\\npotential.\\n\\nOsteoporotic patient-derived cells transfected with L1 RNA show a higher expression of early differentiation\\n\\nmarkers, with a peak 48h after L1 transfection (day 7) (Figure 3H). Bone sialoprotein (IBSP), a late osteogenic gene,\\n\\nshows a similar profile, being almost 6 times more expressed in L1- than in RFP-transfected cells on day 7\\n\\n(Appendix Figure S1A). Strikingly, although alkaline phosphatase (ALPL) expression slightly increases at later time\\n\\npoints (Appendix Figure S1A), its activity is not enhanced in L1-treated cells (Appendix Figure S2A). However, the\\n\\nactivity of ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1) is gradually and significantly reduced by\\n\\nL1 RNA transfection (Appendix Figure S2B). As ENPP1 is a major source of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), one of\\n\\nthe main physiological inhibitors of mineralization,(FLEISCH et al, 1966) (Johnson et al, 2000) (Hessle et al, 2002)\\n\\nthe reduction of its activity may contribute to the enhanced mineralization observed in L1-RNA transfected cells.\\n\\nAltogether, these data suggest that L1 RNA induces a unique mineralizing phenotype and apparently distinct from\\n\\nthe well-known canonical differentiation mechanisms.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nL1 RNA delivery induces inflammatory pathways significantly overlapping those involved in bone fracture\\n\\nrepair\\n\\nTo investigate the molecular response of osteoblasts to L1 RNA transfection, we profiled their transcriptome by\\n\\nIllumina RNA-Seq 24h post-transfection. We found 482 differentially expressed genes (DEG) (FDR<0.05) between\\n\\nL1 and RFP RNA-treated OB (268 upregulated and 214 downregulated) (Appendix Figure S3). Gene ontology (GO)\\n\\nenrichment analysis revealed that the early transcriptional signature of L1-treated osteoblasts is typical of that of an\\n\\ninflammatory response (Figure 4A and 4B). This is in accordance with the recent evidence of a link between L1 and\\n\\nother retrotransposons accumulation in the cytoplasm and inflammatory response in vitro and in vivo.(Fukuda et al,\\n\\n2021) (De Cecco et al, 2019b) (Simon et al, 2019) GO term enrichment analysis comparison between the early stage\\n\\nof fracture-induced bone healing in vivo(Coates et al, 2019) and differentiating osteoblasts in vitro 24h post-L1\\n\\ndelivery (Figure 4A) revealed a matching inflammatory response and shared upregulated pathways (Figure 4C)\\n\\nessential for effective bone repair.(Maruyama et al, 2020) (Gerstenfeld et al, 2003) (Kon et al, 2001) Recruitment of\\n\\nneutrophils at the site of injury also indicates a healthy repair process, particularly in bone.(Kovtun et al, 2016)\\n\\nExtracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) and 2 (ERK2), play crucial roles in bone formation(Xiao et al, 2000)\\n\\n(Xiao et al, 2002b) (Xiao et al, 2002a) (Matsushita et al, 2009) (Ge et al, 2007) and seem to be the most upstream\\n\\ninitiators of tissue regeneration in planaria.(Owlarn et al, 2017) Upon bone injury, an initial transient stage of acute\\n\\ninflammation is a crucial factor in ensuring an effective regeneration(Maruyama et al, 2020) whereas an\\n\\nexcessive/prolonged (chronic) inflammation is deleterious for the healing environment.(Chan et al, 2012) (Hurtgen\\n\\net al, 2016) (Clark et al, 2017) (Brem & Tomic-Canic, 2007) (Timmen et al, 2014) (Schmidt-Bleek et al, 2012)\\n\\n(Weckbach et al, 2013) We followed the time-course expression of âinflammatory responseâ (GO:0006954) and\\n\\nâimmune responseâ (GO:0006955) genes upregulated by L1 RNA immediately after transfection. As shown in\\n\\nFigure 4D, their expression is already strongly reduced at day 10 and almost entirely silenced by day 14, suggesting\\n\\nthe transient dynamics of the inflammatory response triggered in vitro by L1 RNA. This is coherent with our\\n\\nprevious observation that exogenous L1 RNA is gradually secreted by the cell together with matrix components\\n\\n(Figure 3B and C), eventually clearing out the initial inflammatory stimulus.\\n\\nCellular response to increased cytoplasmic level of L1 RNA is mediated by PKR\\n\\nIt has been previously demonstrated that the cytoplasmic accumulation of L1-derived cDNA triggers an\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\ninflammatory response mediated by the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING)\\n\\ncytosolic DNA sensing pathway.(De Cecco et al, 2019a) Immunofluorescence (IF) analysis reveals that the\\n\\nexogenous L1 RNA forms DNA:RNA hybrids (Appendix Figure S4), suggesting that L1 RNA is reversed\\n\\ntranscribed into cDNA after its transfection. Notably, ORF1p was undetectable by WB in differentiating osteoblasts\\n\\nand in L1 transfected osteoblasts (Appendix Figure S5), indicating that the exogenous L1 RNA is not translated after\\n\\ntransfection. To assess whether L1-induced inflammation was triggered by the sensing of its cDNA, we used\\n\\nLamivudine 3TC and G140 (Figure 5A) to inhibit the ORF2-mediated reverse transcription of L1 RNA and cGAS\\n\\nactivity, respectively. Moreover, we also performed a siRNA-mediated knockdown (KD) of cGAS (Appendix Figure\\n\\nS6). (Jones et al, 2008) (Lama et al, 2019) Surprisingly, none of the treatments impaired the mineralization induced\\n\\nby L1 RNA delivery (Figure 5A, Appendix Figure S6C), suggesting that the observed cellular response depends\\n\\nentirely on RNA sensing. As previously mentioned, repeats are a major source of endogenous dsRNA,(Sadeq et al,\\n\\n2021) (Chen & Hur, 2022) and L1 RNA, in particular, is able to form intramolecular double-stranded structures.\\n\\n(Hur, 2019) As expected, we found a tight colocalization between L1 RNA and dsRNA IF signal (Figure 5B). One of\\n\\nthe main cellular sensors of dsRNA, including those derived from retrotransposons, is PKR.(Kim et al, 2018) PKR\\n\\nactivation results in the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2\\uf061 (eIF2Î±) and in the subsequent\\n\\ninhibition of global protein synthesis and cell growth.(Donnelly et al, 2013) Interestingly, PKR has been shown to\\n\\ninteract with L1 RNA in vitro.(Kim et al, 2018) Moreover, eIF2Î± phosphorylation has been demonstrated to promote\\n\\nautophagy in osteoblasts and to counteract BMD reduction in osteoporotic ovariectomized mice.(Li et al, 2019)\\n\\nTo demonstrate that L1 RNA is able to trigger a PKR-mediated intracellular response, we transfected L1 RNA in the\\n\\npresence or absence of the PKR inhibitor C16 and evaluated the levels of eIF2Î± phosphorylation by western blot\\n\\n(Figure 5C). The delivery of L1, but not RFP, strongly induces eIF2Î± phosphorylation and this effect is prevented by\\n\\nPKR inhibition (Figure 5C). Notably, eIF2Î± phosphorylation occurs already 6 hours post-transfection. This\\n\\nobservation suggests that PKR activation is one of the first events induced by L1 RNA, thus corroborating the\\n\\nhypothesis of PKR as an endogenous L1 RNA sensor.\\n\\nWe then characterized the proteome of cells 24h post-L1 RNA transfection by diaPASEF mass spectrometry (MS).\\n\\n(Meier et al, 2020a) We detected almost 8000 proteins in each sample, and observed that more than 88% of\\n\\nsignificantly differentially expressed proteins (DEP) were downregulated in L1-treated cells (Figure 5D, left panel).\\n\\nMoreover, among the top 15 downregulated biological processes and cellular components were translation and\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nribosomal subunits (Figure 5D, right panels, yellow circles), indicating that L1 RNA induces a global attenuation of\\n\\nprotein synthesis. Indeed, a cap-dependent translation shutdown is the main consequence of eIF2Î± phosphorylation.\\n\\n(Donnelly et al, 2013) Finally, we show that neither PKR KD (Appendix Figure S6A, B) nor its pharmacological\\n\\ninhibition by C16 treatment (Figure 5E and 5F) prevents L1 RNA-triggered induction of inflammatory genes (Figure\\n\\n5E) and mineral matrix deposition (Figure 5F, Appendix Figure S6B). As previously mentioned, a global reduction\\n\\nof protein synthesis occurs 24h after L1 transfection and only a little percentage of DEP is upregulated in L1\\n\\ncompared to RFP control (Figure 5D). Interestingly, some of the most upregulated proteins are involved in\\n\\nautophagy and vesicle trafficking (Figure 5G). Autophagy is a crucial process for mineralization and bone\\n\\nhomeostasis both in vitro and in vivo,(Nollet et al, 2014) as autophagic vacuoles are exploited to secrete apatite\\n\\ncrystals.\\n\\nAltogether these data demonstrate that the PKR-mediated sensing of L1-derived dsRNA globally attenuates the\\n\\ntranslation via eIF2Î± phosphorylation and indicate autophagy as a possible mechanism involved in L1-induced\\n\\nosteoblasts mineralization.\\n\\nL1 RNA delivery reshapes the secretory profile of differentiating osteoblasts\\n\\nAn inflammatory response translates into a strong secretory activity and production of paracrine signals, and we\\n\\ntherefore tested the effect of âL1-primedâ osteoblast-derived conditioned medium in recipient differentiating\\n\\nosteoblasts (Figure 6A). We found that the âsecretomeâ of cells transfected with L1 RNA has a significant paracrine\\n\\neffect on recipient osteoblasts since they showed an earlier formation of mineralized nodules, already 24h post the\\n\\naddition of conditioned media (Figure 6A, right panel), and higher deposition of mineral matrix at day 10 (Figure\\n\\n6A, left panel). We subsequently isolated bulk and exosome-derived proteomes from conditioned media of\\n\\nuntreated, RFP- and L1-treated differentiating osteoblasts and characterized them by MS. Differential expression\\n\\nanalysis of MS data revealed a unique secretome profile (for both bulk and vesicular proteomes) of L1-primed\\n\\nosteoblasts compared to RFP-primed and untreated osteoblasts (Figure 6B). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of\\n\\ndifferentially expressed proteins showed an enrichment of pro-inflammatory factors (i.e. interleukins and\\n\\nchemokines) involved in immune response and chemotactic migration of immune cells (Figure 6C and D), crucial\\n\\nprocesses for tissue repair mechanisms in vivo. Pro-inflammatory molecules are also a major constituent of the\\n\\nsenescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP),(CoppÃ© et al, 2010) whose transient delivery supports cellular\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nplasticity and tissue regeneration.(Ritschka et al, 2017) Notably, the most enriched protein in L1-specific bulk\\n\\nsecretome is interleukin 8 (IL-8), an inflammatory chemokine involved in several regenerative processes, such as\\n\\nskin wound healing,(JIANG et al, 2012) therapeutic angiogenesis after stroke and ischemia,(Choi et al, 2021) (Hou\\n\\net al, 2014) and osteochondral bone repair.(Lin et al, 2019) (Yang et al, 2018a) Tumor necrosis factor-inducible gene\\n\\n6 (TSG6) is among the top 10 proteins enriched in the bulk secretome of L1-primed osteoblasts compared to RFP.\\n\\nTSG6 is an inflammatory factor with suggestive therapeutic effects in corneal wounds, myocardial infarction,\\n\\ninjured central nervous system, chronic liver damage, and intervertebral disc degeneration.(Zhang et al, 2013) (Lee\\n\\net al, 2015) (Lee et al, 2009) (Wang et al, 2017) (Yang et al, 2018b) Moreover, TSG6 induces autophagy influx both\\n\\nin vivo and in vitro.(Wang et al, 2017) Another protein positively involved in autophagy and found specifically in\\n\\nthe secretome of L1 primed osteoblasts was ATG7 (autophagy-related 7). Osteoblast-specific ATG7 conditional\\n\\nknockout in mice reduced bone mass during developmental and in adult age.(Li et al, 2018) Type 1 lysophosphatidic\\n\\nacid receptor (LPAR1) is also specifically secreted by L1-primed osteoblasts and has proven to be positively\\n\\ninvolved in bone mineralization in vitro and in vivo.(Alioli et al, 2020) (Gennero et al, 2011)\\n\\nAltogether, our findings demonstrate that cytoplasmic L1 RNA is sensed by PKR, whose activation leads to eIF2Î±\\n\\nphosphorylation with consequent reprogramming of transcription and translation. The ultimate consequence of this\\n\\nL1-induced, PKR-mediated stress response in osteoblasts is a major reprogramming of their secretory activity,\\n\\nleading to a paracrine effect on recipient osteogenic competent cells to trigger their mineralization activity.\\n\\n# Discussion\\n\\nThe concerted co-option of TEs markedly changed whole regulatory networks and integrated new functions into the\\n\\neukaryote genome.(Cosby et al, 2019) (Mangiavacchi et al, 2021) (Carelli et al, 2022) However, while the role of\\n\\nTEs as evolutionary drivers is today well-established, their contribution to cell physiology, particularly in somatic\\n\\ncells, remains to be elucidated. Indeed, aside from their role in the nucleus, (Della Valle et al, 2022) (Jachowicz et al\\n\\n, 2017) (Lu et al, 2021) (Percharde et al, 2018) TEs represent a major source of endogenous dsRNA whose role in\\n\\ntriggering inflammatory and innate immune responses in various physiological processes has increasingly gained\\n\\nattention.(Sadeq et al, 2021) (Chen & Hur, 2022) For instance, an early acute inflammatory response is of vital\\n\\nimportance in initiating and orchestrating bone repair and induce anabolism leading to fracture healing. (Mountziaris\\n\\net al, 2011) (Marsell & Einhorn, 2011) (Bahney et al, 2019) Moreover, several studies demonstrated a positive effect\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nof proinflammatory mediators on bone mineralization in vitro and in vivo,(Croes et al, 2015) (Croes et al, 2016) (Li\\n\\net al, 2016) (Croes et al, 2017) indicating that the modulation of inflammatory reaction is a tool to pursue\\n\\nregenerative strategies in bone.(Roberts & Ke, 2018) We found that, in the bone of newly fractured mice, a group of\\n\\nTEs, mostly LINE and LTR, was early, markedly and transiently upregulated. Interestingly, the expression of these\\n\\nTEs was limited to the earliest phase of the inflammatory stage. In line with the hypothesis of a positive correlation\\n\\nbetween stress-induced bone mineralization and TEs activation, the expression dynamics in human bone biopsies\\n\\nrevealed a significant upregulation of TEs in the femur, a bone subjected to high mechanical stresses, high turnover\\n\\nand anabolism, compared to ilium, not weight bearing. Furthermore, we detected a lower TEs expression in donors\\n\\nwith compromised bone mineralization and a significant correlation between TEs expression and local BMD. We\\n\\nhypothesized that the expression dynamics of TEs in fracture/mechanical stress observed in vivo could mimic the\\n\\nimmunological threshold model of the sterile activation of dsRNA sensors as a response to stressful conditions.\\n\\nIndeed, the transient and controlled breaching of the activation threshold of dsRNA sensors may lead to sterile\\n\\ninflammation being integrated into physiological processes.(Chen & Hur, 2022) To test further this hypothesis, we\\n\\ndelivered a full-length L1 consensus sequence as source of dsRNA(Hur, 2019) to differentiating osteoblasts in vitro\\n\\nand showed that L1 RNA initially accumulated in the cytoplasm and is gradually cleared by secretion. The increased\\n\\ncytoplasmic levels of L1 RNA are immediately sensed by PKR, a cytoplasmic dsRNA sensor whose activation\\n\\ninduces the phosphorylation of eIF2\\uf061\\uf028\\uf04b\\uf069\\uf06d \\uf065\\uf074 \\uf061\\uf06c\\uf02c \\uf032\\uf030\\uf031\\uf038\\uf029 \\uf028\\uf044\\uf06f\\uf06e\\uf06e\\uf065\\uf06c\\uf06c\\uf079 \\uf065\\uf074 \\uf061\\uf06c\\uf02c \\uf032\\uf030\\uf031\\uf033\\uf029, leading to the attenuation of\\n\\nglobal protein synthesis (Donnelly et al, 2013), induction of inflammatory response, and stimulation of mineral\\n\\nmatrix deposition. In support of the evidence that PKR is the early sensor of increased L1 RNA cytoplasmic levels,\\n\\nwe show that inhibition of PKR activation by C16 prevents L1-induced eIF2\\uf061 phosphorylation, induction of\\n\\ninflammatory genes, and mineral matrix deposition. Moreover, the inhibition of L1 cDNA formation and sensing by\\n\\nLamivudine 3TC, G140, or cGAS KD does not affect the L1-induced phenotype. Thus, the evidence does not\\n\\nsupport that the L1-triggered inflammation is causally connected to a cGAS-STING-dependent sensing of cytosolic\\n\\nL1 cDNA, a mechanism demonstrated operative in senescence.(De Cecco et al, 2019a)\\n\\nL1 RNA response showed high specificity, as demonstrated by the dose-dependent increase of mineralization and\\n\\nthe lack of significant changes in mineral deposition when negative control RNA was transfected, even at 100-200\\nfold higher concentration. Although the molecular mechanism behind L1-induced stress response which stimulates\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nthe mineralization activity of osteoblasts remains elusive, our results indicate that L1 stimulates the mineral matrix\\n\\ndeposition by bone-forming cells regardless of their prior intrinsic anabolic potential. Moreover, MS results\\n\\nsuggested that increased autophagy, a process crucial for mineralization and bone homeostasis in vitro and in vivo\\n\\n(Nollet et al, 2014) may contribute to L1-induced hydroxyapatite deposition. Intriguingly, the osteoinductive\\n\\nproperties of L1-primed osteoblast-derived secretome and the observation that L1 RNA was gradually secreted by\\n\\nthe cells may suggest an involvement of L1 RNA in cell-to-cell communication, in line with the recent finding of\\n\\nother retrotransposons (i.e. ERV) acting as paracrine molecules.(Liu et al, 2021) This, together with the observed\\n\\nL1-dependent induction of CCL and CXCL chemokines and cytokines, being chemoattractants of immune cells and\\n\\nendothelial cells,(Bischoff et al, 2011) (Eash et al, 2010) (Strieter et al, 2005) and the composition of L1-primed\\n\\nosteoblast secretome, makes the in vivo delivery of L1 RNA a necessary step to evaluate its actual contribution to\\n\\nthe paracrine processes that orchestrate bone repair mechanisms. (Chaparro & Linero, 2016) (Nimiritsky et al, 2019)\\n\\nThe identification of repeats RNA, particularly L1, as potential resilient molecular factors involved in stress\\ninduced, inflammation-mediated bone production points out new avenues to develop anabolic strategies for the\\n\\ntreatment of bone loss conditions, such as osteoporosis or impaired bone repair.(Roberts & Ke, 2018) On the other\\n\\nhand, repeats may be novel targets in the treatment of those conditions characterized by excessive or heterotopic\\n\\nossification preceded by deregulated/chronic inflammation.(Lories & Schett, 2012) (Balboni et al, 2006)\\n\\n# Materials and Methods\\n\\nParticipants and ethics\\n\\nFemoral bone biopsies were obtained from the caput region of postmenopausal women or men with a wide BMD\\n\\nrange, i.e., from healthy to osteoporotic, who were undergoing hip replacement surgery due to osteoarthritis or\\n\\nfracture at Lovisenberg Diaconal Hospital (Oslo, Norway) or Diakonhiemmet Hospital (Oslo, Norway), respectively.\\n\\nThe donors of femoral bones are listed in Appendix Table S1. The postmenopausal iliac bone donors were recruited\\n\\nfrom the outpatient clinic of Lovisenberg Diaconal Hospital (Oslo, Norway). Candidates filled out a questionnaire\\n\\nthat included medication and lifestyle factors, and selected donors were deemed representative of the Oslo-based\\n\\nNorwegian ethnic female population aged 50 to 86 years. The iliac bone donors are listed in Appendix Table S2 and\\n\\nhave been described previously in detail.(Reppe et al, 2010) All donors taking medication or having diseases, other\\n\\nthan primary osteoporosis, known to affect bone metabolism were excluded.

RNA quality and concentration were checked using a Nanodrop[TM] 2000 spectrophotometer\\n\\n(ThermoFisher). cDNA was synthesized from 200ng of each RNA sample using a Superscript III first-strand cDNA\\n\\nsynthesis system (ThermoFisher, cat. No.18080051) according to the manufacturerâs protocol. Processing of human\\n\\nbone biopsies and RNA isolation has been described previously.(Reppe et al, 2010)\\n\\nGene expression analysis\\n\\nReal-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed with a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR\\n\\nsystem (Applied Biosystems). Each sample was analyzed in triplicate and normalized with the endogenous control\\n\\nRibosomal Protein L13A (RPL13A) for cDNA input concentration. No template and no RT were included as\\n\\nnegative controls. For each 15\\uf06dl reaction, 10ng (1ng for L1) of cDNA was mixed with 1\\uf06dM specific primers mix\\n\\nand 7.5\\uf06dl of Sybr[TM ]Select Master mix (Applied Biosystems, USA, Cat. No. 4472908). The reaction was incubated\\n\\nat 95Â°C for 10 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95Â°C for 15 seconds, annealing at 60Â°C for 30\\n\\nseconds and elongation at 72Â°C for 30 seconds. Ct values were calculated by 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR RQ\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nmanager software (Applied Biosystems, USA) and then normalized as \\uf044Ct between the gene of interest and the\\n\\nendogenous calibrator. Primers used in this study for gene expression analysis were designed using Primer3 (\\n\\n[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/). In all primer pairs, each primer matches a different exon.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/)\\n\\nAmplicons length was 80-130 nucleotides. Primer sequences are reported in Appendix Table S3.\\n\\nCell cycle analysis\\n\\n2x10[5] MSCs were trypsinized for 5 min at 37Â°C, washed with PBS and 2% BSA, passed through a 70\\uf06dM strainer\\n\\n(Corning, USA, Cat. No. 352350) and then fixed at -20Â°C for 30 min in 70% ethanol. After washing with PBS and\\n\\n4% BSA, cells were resuspended in PBS and incubated for 1 hour at 37Â°C with RNase. Cells were then washed and\\n\\nresuspended in 100\\uf06dl of Flow Cytometry Staining Buffer (R&D System, USA, Cat. No. FC001). 10\\uf06dl of 1mg/ml\\n\\nPropidium iodide (PI) staining solution (Invitrogen, USA, Cat. No. P3566) was added to the single-cell solution,\\n\\ngently mixed, and incubated for 5 min in the dark. Cell cycle analysis was performed on BD FACSCanto II Flow\\n\\nCytometry System (BD-Biosciences), using BD FACSDiva Software (BD-Biosciences).\\n\\nRNA-Seq and data analysis\\n\\nRNA from human bone biopsies was sequenced at the Human Genotyping facility (HuGe-F) of Erasmus MC.\\n\\nTotal RNA-Seq library, from L1 RNA delivery experiments, was prepared with CORALL Total RNA library prep\\n\\nwith RiboCop rRNA for Human/Mouse/Rat depletion kit (Lexogen GmbH, Vienna, Austria) following\\n\\nmanufacturerâs instructions (library type: fr-secondstrand) by IGA Technology service (Italy). The final libraries\\n\\nwere checked using both Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and Agilent Bioanalyzer DNA assay or\\n\\nCaliper (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). Libraries were then prepared for sequencing and sequenced on paired-end\\n\\n150 bp mode on NovaSeq6000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). RNA-Seq read quality control (QC) analyses and\\n\\nfiltering of high-quality reads were executed using FastQC v0.11.9\\n\\n(http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) and BBDuk v35.85 [(https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/software-tools/bbtools/bb-tools-user-guide/bbduk-guide/__;!!Nmw4Hv0!0EikfGZVN-B-Xp5VkKLqowTItYk7Yav6lOsagjvuQwPqWY_Y3yszwKePkxm4puTKivdPL5LvCMjrSQwcKpyz9m7YVqqz09ekvfk$)\\n\\n[tools/software-tools/bbtools/bb-tools-user-guide/bbduk-guide/) by setting a minimum read length of 35 bp and a](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/software-tools/bbtools/bb-tools-user-guide/bbduk-guide/__;!!Nmw4Hv0!0EikfGZVN-B-Xp5VkKLqowTItYk7Yav6lOsagjvuQwPqWY_Y3yszwKePkxm4puTKivdPL5LvCMjrSQwcKpyz9m7YVqqz09ekvfk$)\\n\\nminimum Phred-quality score of 25. After trimming quality control, high-quality reads were aligned to the human\\n\\ngenome reference (GRCh38) with STAR 2.7.3a,(Dobin et al, 2013) while FeatureCounts 1.6.3 package(Liao et al,\\n\\n2014) was used to assign reads to genes. Next, lowly expressed genes across one or more experimental conditions\\n\\nwere filtered to eliminate the âuninformativeâ genes using HTSFilter v1.30.1.(Rau et al, 2013) Filtered gene data\\n\\nwere further processed with the EdgeR package v3.32.1(Robinson et al, 2010) to normalize (Trimmed Mean of M-7\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nvalues, TMM, method) the raw counts and perform differential gene expression analysis. Multiple testing correction\\n\\nwas performed with the FDR method(Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995) and significance level was set at FDR < 0.05.\\n\\nGene Ontology (GO) term enrichment was analyzed by performing hypergeometric tests11 for each individual term,\\n\\nand FDR correction was applied (FDR < 0.05). Expression of Interspersed Repeat elements was quantified using\\n\\nSQuiRE 0.9.9.92 (https://github.com/wyang17/SquIRE). SQuiRE provides locus-specific expression quantification\\n\\nalong with subfamily-level expression estimates counting unambiguously mapped reads, as well as ambiguously\\n\\nmapped reads using an expectationâmaximization (EM) algorithm.(Yang et al, 2019) Briefly, reference genome and\\n\\nRepeatmasker annotation were downloaded from UCSC and prepared for the analysis with squire Fetch and squire\\n\\nClean, respectively. High-quality reads were mapped against the reference genome with STAR using squire Map and\\n\\nexpression was quantified using squire Call. Differential expression analysis was performed with squire Call.\\n\\nDIA-MS analysis using TimsTOF MS\\n\\nTotal protein extracts were prepared with RIPA buffer (50mMTris-cl pH 8.0, 5mM EDTA, 150mM Nacl, 15mM\\n\\nMgCl2, 1% NP-40, 1mM PMSF and 1X Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (PIC)). Further sonication step was included:\\n\\n(30S ON, 30S OFF, 10 cycles with Bioruptor). Equal 50 \\uf06dg protein extracts were concentrated to 30 \\uf06dl volume, then\\n\\ndiluted in 8M urea in 0.1M Tris-HCl, followed by protein digestion with trypsin, according to the FASP protocol.\\n\\n(WiÅniewski et al, 2009) After overnight digestion, the peptides were eluted from the filters with 25 mM ammonium\\n\\nbicarbonate buffer. The eluted peptides were processed in the desalting step using Sep-Pag C18 Column (waters)\\n\\nbased on the manufacturerâs instructions. Approximately 200 ng of peptide mixture per sample was analyzed using a\\n\\ntimsTOF Pro 2 QTOF mass spectrometer coupled with a nanoElute liquid chromatography system (Bruker Daltonik\\n\\nGmbH, Germany). The sample was injected directly into an RP-C18 Aurora emitter column (75 Âµm i.d.Ã 250 mm,\\n\\n1.6 Î¼m, 120 Ã pore size) (Ion Opticks, Australia) using a one-column separation method. An 80-min gradient was\\n\\nestablished using mobile phase A (0.1% FA in H2O) and mobile phase B (0.1% FA in Acetonitrile): 2â25% B for\\n\\n60 min, 25â37% for 10 min, ramping 37% to 95% in 5 min, and maintaining 95% B for 5 min. The column\\n\\ntemperature was set at 50[o]C and the flow rate at 250 nl/min. The sample eluting from the separation column was\\n\\nintroduced into the mass spectrometer via a CaptiveSpray nano-electrospray ion source (Bruker Daltonik GmbH)\\n\\nwith an electrospray voltage of 1.6 kV. The ion source temperature was set to 180 Â°C and a dry gas of 3 l/min. The\\n\\nsamples were analyzed using diaPASEF scheme(Meier et al, 2020b) consisting of 24 cycles including a total of 48\\n\\nmass width windows (13 Da (m/z) from m/z 400 to 1,000 and TIMS scan range from 0.63 to 1.35 Vs cmâ2 (1/K0).\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nThe collisional energy increased linearly from 20.01 eV at 0.6 (1/K0) to 52.00 eV at 1.35 Vs cmâ2 (1/K0). The scan\\n\\nrange for MS and MS/MS spectra was set to 100-1700 m/z. TIMS ramping time and accumulation time were set to\\n\\n100 milliseconds. The diaPASEF data were analyzed by directDIA approach using Spectronaut software (version 14)\\n\\nfollowing manufacture instructions. Up or down regulated proteins were determined using DEP (Differential\\n\\nEnrichment analysis of Proteomics data) R package. Significant results (adjusted p-value < 0.05) were subjected to\\n\\nGene Ontology enrichment analysis with clusterProfiler R package.\\n\\nWestern Blot\\n\\nTotal protein extracts were prepared by lysing cells in extraction buffer (HEPES KOH [pH 8.5], NaCl 400 mM,\\n\\nEDTA 0.1 mM, EGTA 0.1 mM, DTT 1 mM, 1Ã protease inhibitor, SDS 1%). Proteins were separated by\\n\\nelectrophoresis on BOLT 4%â12% bis-tris polyacrylamide precast gels in MES buffer (Life Technologies) and\\n\\ntransferred to a 0,2 \\uf06dm nitrocellulose membrane. Non-specific signals were blocked with 5% Milk-PBS-Tween0.5%\\n\\nand the membrane hybridized overnight at 4Â°C with primary and secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer.\\n\\nHorseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were revealed with the ECL chemiluminescence kit\\n\\n(Amersham), and signals were detected using ChemiDoc (Bio-Rad). Primary antibodies: PKR (rabbit, Abcam,\\n\\nab32052), cGAS (rabbit, Abcam, ab224144), LINE-1 ORF1 (mouse, Merck Millipore, MABC1152), EIF2a (mouse,\\n\\nAbcam, ab5369\\uf029\\uf02c phospho-EIF2\\uf061 (rabbit, Abcam, ab32157), Histone H3 (rabbit, Merk, 06-755).\\n\\nExosome isolation\\n\\nExosomes were isolated using Total Exosome Isolation Reagent (from cell culture media) (Thermo), following\\n\\nmanufacturerâs instructions. The exosome pellet was resuspended in 50 \\uf06dl of RIPA buffer and kept on ice for 30â,\\n\\nmixing every 5â.

Here we present transcriptional\\n\\n31 profiling of HER2+ breast cancer cells transitioning from dormant drug tolerant cells\\n\\n32 to re-proliferating cells under continuous HER2 inhibitor (HER2i) therapy. Focusing\\n\\n33 on phosphatases, expression of dual-specificity phosphatase DUSP6 was found\\n\\n34 inhibited in dormant cells, but strongly induced upon re-growth. DUSP6 expression\\n\\n35 also selectively associated with poor patient survival in HER2+ breast cancers.\\n\\n36 DUSP6 overexpression conferred apoptosis resistance, whereas its pharmacological\\n\\n37 blockade prevented therapy tolerance development under HER2i therapy. DUSP6\\n\\n38 targeting also synergized with clinically used HER2i combination therapies.\\n\\n39 Mechanistically DUSP6 is a positive regulator of HER3 expression, and its impact\\n\\n40 on HER2i tolerance was mediated by neuregulin-HER3 axis. _In vivo,_ genetic\\n\\n41 targeting of _DUSP6_ reduced tumor growth in brain metastasis model, whereas its\\n\\n42 pharmacological targeting induced synthetic lethal therapeutic effect in combination\\n\\n43 with HER2i. Collectively this work demonstrates that _DUSP6 drives escape from_\\n\\n44 HER2i-induced dormancy, and that DUSP6 is a druggable target to overcome\\n\\n45 HER3-driven TKI resistance.\\n\\n46 Keywords: Non-genetic drug tolerance, Lapatinib, Neratinib, BCI, FOXM1\\n\\n47\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n48\\n\\n49 **The paper explained:**\\n\\n50\\n\\n51 **Problem**\\n\\n52 The molecular mechanisms for the acquisition of resistance to HER2-targeted\\n\\n53 therapies in breast cancer are still elusive, especially when the drug-tolerant\\n\\n54 persister cells start to regrow under the treatment.\\n\\n55 **Results**\\n\\n56 The oncogenic phosphatase DUSP6 is increased in the drug-tolerant emerging\\n\\n57 persister cells and plays central roles in the acquisition of HER2i resistance.\\n\\n58 Moreover, DUSP6 blockade potentiates therapeutic sensitivity in the primary\\n\\n59 resistant models via inhibition of the HER3 signaling pathway. Inhibition of DUSP6\\n\\n60 offers advantages over AKT blockade, including induction of apoptotic cell death,\\n\\n61 preempting ligand-induced rescue, and inhibition of HER3. Ultimately, DUSP6\\n\\n62 inhibition reverses HER2i resistance _in vivo_ and reduces the outgrowth of HER2+\\n\\n63 cell in the brain metastasis models.\\n\\n64 **Impact**\\n\\n65 These findings have implications in the clinical management of HER2+ breast cancer\\n\\n66 and warrant development and clinical investigation of DUSP6 inhibitors in\\n\\n67 combination with HER2-directed therapies in the patients.\\n\\n68\\n\\n69\\n\\n70\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n71 **Introduction**\\n\\n72\\n\\n73 To develop therapeutic resistance, tumor cells undergo distinct evolutionary stages,\\n\\n74 starting with induction of dormancy and non-genetic drug tolerance, followed by\\n\\n75 epigenetic changes and finally resistance-conferring genetic mutations (De Conti et\\n\\n76 _al, 2021; Hata et al, 2016; Marine et al, 2020). These different phases were originally_\\n\\n77 demonstrated for EGFR-targeted therapies in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)\\n\\n78 cells (Sharma et al, 2010), but the concept has been expanded more recently to\\n\\n79 other malignancies including HER2+ breast cancer (Chang et al, 2022; De Conti et\\n\\n80 _al., 2021; Dhimolea et al, 2021; Hata et al., 2016; Kurppa et al, 2020; Sharma et al.,_\\n\\n81 2010). Based on these studies, there is ample of omics data from dormant cells (also\\n\\n82 called as drug tolerant persisters; DTPs) from different cancer types treated with\\n\\n83 variety of therapies. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms\\n\\n84 behind the regrowth of DTPs under continuous therapy is still rudimentary.\\n\\n85 Especially, to our knowledge there are no published studies describing\\n\\n86 transcriptional landscapes of transition from DTP to drug tolerant expanding cells\\n\\n87 (DTEP), or transition of DTEP cells to long term resistant (LR) cells upon TKI\\n\\n88 therapies.\\n\\n89\\n\\n90 The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; encoded by _ERBB2) is_\\n\\n91 overexpressed in â¼15-25% of human breast cancers and associates with a poor\\n\\n92 patient survival (Arteaga & Engelman, 2014; Haikala & Janne, 2021). HER2 belongs\\n\\n93 to the ERBB family of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) with four members: HER1\\n\\n94 (EGFR), HER2, HER3 and HER4. Upon ligand binding, the ERBB receptors homo\\n95 and heterodimerize and activate downstream signaling pathways including PI3K/AKT\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n96 and RAS/MAPK/ERK, which regulate cell proliferation, survival and the metastatic\\n\\n97 dissemination (Arteaga & Engelman, 2014; Haikala & Janne, 2021). Multiple HER2\\n98 targeted therapies, including the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab and small\\n\\n99 molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been approved for the treatment of\\n\\n100 HER2-overexpressing (HER2+) breast cancer (Goutsouliak et al, 2020). Application\\n\\n101 of anti-HER2 agents in combination with chemotherapy has significantly improved\\n\\n102 the patientsâ outcome. However, patients initially responsive to the HER2 inhibitors\\n\\n103 (HER2is) almost inevitably succumb to disease relapse (Goutsouliak et al., 2020).\\n\\n104 Moreover, HER2+ breast tumors have an inherent tendency to develop brain\\n\\n105 metastasis, a significant clinical challenge for the treatment of these patients (Fecci\\n\\n106 _et al, 2019). Therefore, there is a pressing need for novel and more efficacious_\\n\\n107 therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance to HER2is.\\n\\n108\\n\\n109 HER3 is an obligate heterodimerization partner for HER2 and plays essential roles in\\n\\n110 HER2-driven tumorigenesis, and resistance to HER2is (Haikala & Janne, 2021;\\n\\n111 Wilson et al, 2012). Consistent with the effects of HER3 overexpression, the HER3\\n\\n112 ligand neuregulin (NRG, a.k.a Heregulin; HRG) promotes trastuzumab resistance in\\n\\n113 HER2+ breast cancer cells (Haikala & Janne, 2021). Importantly, the NRG-HER3\\n\\n114 axis also promotes resistance to a wide range of TKIs and chemotherapies (Erjala et\\n\\n115 _al, 2006; Haikala & Janne, 2021; Knuefermann et al, 2003; Recondo et al, 2020;_\\n\\n116 Wilson et al., 2012; Yonesaka et al, 2011). Despite the importance of HER3 in\\n\\n117 cancer progression and therapy resistance, development of HER3 small molecule\\n\\n118 inhibitors has been challenging due to its impaired kinase activity (Haikala & Janne,\\n\\n119 2021; Xie et al, 2014). Moreover, the clinical activity of HER3 monoclonal antibodies\\n\\n120 either as monotherapies or in combination with chemo- and targeted therapies have\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n121 been marginal (Cleary et al, 2017; Haikala & Janne, 2021; Schneeweiss et al, 2018).\\n\\n122 To this end, there is a pressing need to identify novel strategies to inhibit HER3\\n\\n123 activity and/or expression for the treatment of HER3-dependent human malignancies\\n\\n124 (Gaborit et al, 2015; Haikala & Janne, 2021; Xie et al., 2014).\\n\\n125\\n\\n126 There is emerging evidence that phosphatases are novel and âdruggableâ targets in\\n\\n127 oncology (Lazo et al, 2018; Vainonen et al, 2021). Inhibition of oncogenic\\n\\n128 phosphatases, or re-activation of tumor suppressor phosphatases, by small molecule\\n\\n129 therapies halt tumor growth, retard malignant progression, and enhance therapeutic\\n\\n130 sensitivity in various neoplasms (Lazo et al., 2018; Vainonen et al., 2021). Despite\\n\\n131 this, the contribution of phosphatases to resistance to HER2is is still poorly\\n\\n132 understood. Dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) belong to the superfamily of\\n\\n133 protein tyrosine phosphatases and dephoshorylate both tyrosines and serines or\\n\\n134 threonines. A subgroup of the DUSPs are mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)\\n\\n135 phosphatases that selectively interact with and dephosphorylate the MAPKs\\n\\n136 (Patterson et al, 2009; Zandi et al, 2022). For instance, DUSP6 displays a high\\n\\n137 degree of substrate selectivity for the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), but\\n\\n138 not P38 or c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (Zandi et al., 2022). However, recent\\n\\n139 studies indicate that at least some cancer relevant DUSP6 functions may by ERK\\n140 independent (Kong et al, 2023). DUSP6 is indicated in clinical cancer progression,\\n\\n141 and its genetic inhibition prevents tumor cell growth (Shojaee et al, 2015; Wu et al,\\n\\n142 2018). Notably, DUSP6 is a druggable phosphatase (Korotchenko et al, 2014;\\n\\n143 Molina et al, 2009; Vainonen et al., 2021; Zandi et al., 2022). The best characterized\\n\\n144 DUSP6 inhibitor molecule BCI ((E)-2-Benzylidene-3-(cyclohexylamino)-2,3-dihydro\\n145 1H-inden-1-one), is a semi-allosteric inhibitor of both DUSP1 and 6 that phenocopies\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n146 genetic DUSP6 inhibition in several cancer models (Kong et al., 2023; Korotchenko\\n\\n147 _et al., 2014; Molina et al., 2009; Vainonen et al., 2021). However, the role and_\\n\\n148 potential of therapeutic targeting of DUSP6 in overcoming resistance to HER2is is\\n\\n149 currently unknown.\\n\\n150\\n\\n151 Here we present transcriptional analysis of HER2i treated HER2+ cancer cells upon\\n\\n152 9 months of continuous HER2i treatment. In addition to revealing first global gene\\n\\n153 expression programs associated with the DTP-DTEP and DTEP-LR therapy\\n\\n154 tolerance transitions, we use complementary genetic and pharmacological\\n\\n155 approaches to demonstrate that _DUSP6 has critical role in regrowth of DTEP cells_\\n\\n156 under HER2i therapies. Mechanistically, DUSP6 drives non-genetic HER2i tolerance\\n\\n157 via regulation of HER3 expression, and by abrogating neuregulin-elicited apoptosis\\n\\n158 resistance. Collectively our findings provide a strong pre-clinical rationale to further\\n\\n159 advance in DUSP6 blockade for HER3 targeting in general, and especially for the\\n\\n160 clinical management of HER2+ breast cancer patients with resistance to HER2i.\\n\\n161\\n\\n162\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n163 **Results**\\n\\n164\\n\\n165 **Development of acquired HER2i resistance by long-term treatment of drug**\\n\\n166 **sensitive HER2+ breast cancer cells with lapatinib**\\n\\n167\\n\\n168 To model the full range of development of HER2i resistance starting from primary\\n\\n169 sensitive phase, via drug-tolerant persister (DTP) development, and re-emergence of\\n\\n170 proliferative drug-tolerant expanded persister (DTEP) cells, to long-term resistant\\n\\n171 cells (LR), the HER2i sensitive cell line BT474, and its brain seeking variant BT474Br\\n\\n172 (Zhang et al, 2013), were exposed to therapeutically relevant 1 \\uf06dM of lapatinib every\\n\\n173 3 days for up to 9 months (Fig. 1A). Both cell lines followed a similar pattern of\\n\\n174 lapatinib tolerance development, where at the 9-day timepoint only a few DTP cells\\n\\n175 could be microscopically observed, whereas the emergence DTEP population took\\n\\n176 about 6 months (Fig. 1A). Following this, the plates were fully populated by the LR\\n\\n177 cells after 9 months of continuous lapatinib treatment (Fig. 1A). Importantly, in\\n\\n178 addition to lapatinib, the LR clones of both BT474 and BT474Br displayed strong\\n\\n179 cross resistance to tucatinib (a HER2i), afatinib (a HER2/EGFR inhibitor), and\\n\\n180 neratinib (a HER2/HER4/EGFR inhibitor) (Figure EV1). This indicates that the\\n\\n181 acquired resistance is not specific to lapatinib but is driven by a mechanism that is\\n\\n182 generally relevant to the ERBB family of RTKs.\\n\\n183\\n\\n184 **Transcriptomic landscape of acquired lapatinib resistance in BT474 cells**\\n\\n185\\n\\n186 Recent studies have focused on the molecular characterization of DTP cells in\\n\\n187 response to kinase inhibitor therapies (Chang et al., 2022; Kurppa et al., 2020;\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n188 Marsolier et al, 2022) but there is no published information about transcriptional\\n\\n189 profiles of TKI treated cells at the DTP-DTEP or DTEP-LR transitions. To this end,\\n\\n190 the transcriptional profiles from each functional state of lapatinib drug tolerance and\\n\\n191 resistance development in BT474 cells were surveyed by bulk RNA-sequencing.\\n\\n192 From three technical replicates per condition, and by using statistical criteria of\\n\\n193 |logFC|>2 and Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p <0.05, upregulation of 144, 1169 and\\n\\n194 16 genes was found upon the control-DTP, DTP-DTEP, and DTEP-LR transitions of\\n\\n195 BT474 cells, respectively (Fig. 1B, Dataset EV1). On the other hand, the number of\\n\\n196 downregulated genes were 517, 930 and 28, respectively (Fig. 1B, Dataset EV1).\\n\\n197 The highest number of differentially regulated genes upon the DTP-DTEP transition\\n\\n198 indicates that this is the transition phase where the BT474 cell fate is most robustly\\n\\n199 impacted during the resistance development. When assessing the patterns of gene\\n\\n200 expression changes by unsupervised soft clustering analysis (Futschik & Carlisle,\\n\\n201 2005), we identified six approximately similar size gene clusters with distinct\\n\\n202 regulation patterns (Appendix Figure S1A). The genes included in these clusters are\\n\\n203 listed in the Dataset EV2. Such regulation patterns indicate that neither gene\\n\\n204 activation nor gene repression characterize lapatinib resistance development in\\n\\n205 BT474 cells, but unique gene expression programs are involved in each of these\\n\\n206 steps.\\n\\n207\\n\\n208 **Gene regulatory mechanisms and hallmarks associated with HER2i resistance**\\n\\n209 **transitions**\\n\\n210\\n\\n211 To understand gene regulatory mechanisms controlling transitions between the\\n\\n212 different phases on lapatinib tolerance and resistance development, we predicted the\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n213 transcription factor binding sites enriched on promoter regions of the differentially\\n\\n214 regulated genes (Fig. 1B, Dataset EV3). Using FDR < 0.05 as a cut-off, the most\\n\\n215 highly enriched transcription factor elements in genes downregulated upon the\\n\\n216 control-DTP transition were E2F4, FOXM1, FLI1, E2F1 and NFYA (Fig. 1B, Dataset\\n\\n217 EV3). Strikingly, most of these transcription factor binding sites were enriched also in\\n\\n218 the genes significantly upregulated in DTEP cells (Fig. 1B in bold, Dataset EV3).\\n\\n219 This indicates that these transcription factors are inactivated co-ordinately upon the\\n\\n220 development of the DTP state and re-activated upon re-growth of the DTEPs. E2F4,\\n\\n221 FOXM1 and E2F1 are all indicated in development and progression of breast cancer.\\n\\n222 We validated inhibition of selected BT474 cell DTP FOXM1 and E2F target genes\\n\\n223 across different HER2+ cells treated with lapatinib to reach the DTP state (Figure\\n\\n224 EV2). On the other hand, binding sites for transcription factors CBX2, ESR1, TCF12\\n\\n225 and ZNF217 were found significantly enriched in the genes downregulated upon\\n\\n226 DTP to DTEP transition, whereas STAT1 and STAT2 were enriched among the\\n\\n227 genes upregulated in LR cells as compared to DTEPs (Fig. 1B, Dataset EV3).\\n\\n228\\n\\n229 To identify cancer hallmark processes involved in each transition phase, the entire\\n\\n230 transcriptomics data was re-analysed by Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA).\\n\\n231 Consistent with recent evidence from other DTP models (Chang et al., 2022;\\n\\n232 Dhimolea et al., 2021; Kurppa et al., 2020), MYC signaling was inhibited in the\\n\\n233 lapatinib-treated BT474 DTPs, but reactivated in DTEPs (Fig. 1C, gene sets 3 and\\n\\n234 6). Similar gene regulation pattern was observed for E2F1 targets, G2/M checkpoint,\\n\\n235 mTOR signaling, and androgen response (Fig. 1C, gene set 3), ROS signaling,\\n\\n236 oxidative phosphorylation, and DNA repair (Fig. 1C, gene set 6). Interestingly, the\\n\\n237 DTP-DTEP transition was associated also with downregulation of several cancer\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n238 hallmark gene sets, most apparently seen in set 4 where KRAS signaling, EMT,\\n\\n239 WNT/Ã-catenin, and inflammatory response genes were all suppressed upon\\n\\n240 proliferation reactivation (Fig. 1C). Additional hallmark gene sets regulated between\\n\\n241 the lapatinib resistance development transitions are displayed in appendix figure\\n\\n242 S1B.\\n\\n243\\n\\n244 Collectively these results demonstrate that unique gene clusters and biological\\n\\n245 processes are involved in each step of lapatinib resistance development. This bulk\\n\\n246 RNA-sequencing data provides a rich resource for future studies of gene regulatory\\n\\n247 mechanisms in HER2i tolerance and resistance development. However, it is clear\\n\\n248 that future single cell RNA sequencing studies are needed to understand clonality of\\n\\n249 gene expression changes induced during these transitions.\\n\\n250\\n\\n251\\n\\n252 **Phosphatase gene expression landscape in DTPs and DTEPs**\\n\\n253\\n\\n254 Recent data indicates that development of cancer therapy resistance is initiated by\\n\\n255 non-genetic signaling rewiring mediated by post-translational regulation of\\n\\n256 intracellular signaling pathways (De Conti et al., 2021; Hata et al., 2016; Marine et\\n\\n257 _al., 2020). Protein phosphorylation is the most prevalent post-translational_\\n\\n258 modification in cancer cells, and cancer cell phosphoproteomes are regulated by\\n\\n259 kinases and phosphatases. Whereas the role of kinases in non-genetic therapy\\n\\n260 tolerance development has been extensively studied (Marine et al., 2020), the\\n\\n261 importance of phosphatases to development of non-genetic kinase inhibitor therapy\\n\\n262 tolerance have been thus far poorly characterized. Therefore, we focused on the\\n\\n263 dynamics of phosphatase gene regulation during lapatinib tolerance development.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n264 Importantly, there were only four phosphatase genes (CDC25A, CDC25C, DUSP6\\n\\n265 and SYNJ1) that were synchronously downregulated in DTP cells but upregulated in\\n\\n266 DTEPs versus DTPs (Fig. 2A-C, Dataset EV1). We rationalized that these four\\n\\n267 phosphatases might be particularly relevant for allowing the regrowth of the DTEP\\n\\n268 population under continuous lapatinib treatment. Even though a large group of other\\n\\n269 genes were found differentially regulated between the DTEP and LR populations\\n\\n270 (Fig. 1B, Dataset EV1 and EV2), none of the phosphatase genes were significantly\\n\\n271 regulated in the DTEP-LR transition (Dataset EV1). This indicates that regulation of\\n\\n272 phosphatase gene expression could be primarily relevant to the early non-genetic\\n\\n273 phases of acquired lapatinib resistance.\\n\\n274\\n\\n275\\n\\n276 **Clinical association of DUSP6 with poor prognosis HER2+ breast cancer**\\n\\n277\\n\\n278 Based on the above analysis, CDC25A, CDC25C, DUSP6 and SYNJ1 were the only\\n\\n279 phosphatases that were significantly regulated during both therapy tolerance\\n\\n280 transitions (Fig. 2A-C). To evaluate potential clinical relevance of the selected four\\n\\n281 phosphatases in human breast cancer, we first examined their expression levels\\n\\n282 across breast cancer subtypes in the METABRIC dataset (Dataref:(Pereira et al,\\n\\n283 2016). Interestingly, DUSP6 was the only one of these four phosphatases that was\\n\\n284 selectively overexpressed in the target HER2+ subtype of breast cancers (Fig. 2D).\\n\\n285 The closest functional orthologue for DUSP6, DUSP1 did not show HER2+ selective\\n\\n286 overexpression (Appendix Figure S2A). _DUSP6 overexpression in HER2+ breast_\\n\\n287 cancer was confirmed in the TCGA breast invasive carcinoma dataset (Dataref:\\n\\n288 (Cerami et al, 2012; de Bruijn et al, 2023; Gao et al, 2013)(Appendix Figure S2B).\\n\\n289 Further, when the 1082 breast invasive carcinoma samples from the TCGA BRCA\\n\\n-----\\n\\n290 dataset (Dataref: (Cerami et al., 2012; de Bruijn et al., 2023; Gao et al., 2013) were\\n\\n291 divided to DUSP6high and DUSP6low groups based on their _DUSP6_ mRNA\\n\\n292 expression levels, HER2+ and luminal A subtypes were clearly enriched among the\\n\\n293 DUSP6high samples (Fig. 2E). HER2 positivity was also found enriched among\\n\\n294 DUSP6high tumors based on HER2 immunohistochemistry of samples available for\\n\\n295 staining in the Breast Invasive Carcinoma (TCGA, Firehose legacy) dataset (Dataref:\\n\\n296 (Cerami et al., 2012; de Bruijn et al., 2023; Gao et al., 2013) (Appendix Figure S2C).\\n\\n297\\n\\n298 To study the prognostic value of DUSP6 expression in HER2+ breast cancers from\\n\\n299 the TCGA BRCA-dataset, the patients with high _ERBB2_ (gene coding for HER2)\\n\\n300 expression were further divided into DUSP6high and low groups. Comparison of the\\n\\n301 survival outcomes between the two groups indicate that high _DUSP6 expression_\\n\\n302 predicts poor overall and disease-free survival among HER2+ patients (Fig. 2F,G). In\\n\\n303 multivariable analysis of high _ERBB2_ expressing tumors, increase in _DUSP6_\\n\\n304 expression and large tumor size (T4) remained significant independent prognostic\\n\\n305 factors (Appendix Figure S2D). However, _DUSP6 mRNA expression was neither a_\\n\\n306 prognostic factor in Luminal B or Basal subtypes, nor across unselected breast\\n\\n307 cancer patient population (Appendix Figure S2E), further highlighting the selective\\n\\n308 connection between DUSP6 and HER2 in breast cancer progression.\\n\\n309\\n\\n310 Interestingly, luminal B cancers were clearly enriched in _DUSP6low samples as_\\n\\n311 compared to _DUSP6high (Fig. 2E). Luminal B are estrogen receptor (ER) positive_\\n\\n312 cancers that often also express HER2. Clinically luminal B cancers are less\\n\\n313 aggressive than HER2+ cancers. This data may suggest that DUSP6 has a role in\\n\\n314 suppressing ER positivity, and thereby increasing the relative numbers of HER2+\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n315 cancers over luminal B cancers. Although the details of this regulation remain\\n\\n316 unclear, this hypothesis is supported by strongly decreased expression of ER protein\\n\\n317 and _ESR1 mRNA, coding for ER, in HER2+_ _DUSP6high samples as compared to_\\n\\n318 HER2+ DUSP6low samples (Appendix Figure S2F,G).\\n\\n319\\n\\n320 These data demonstrate that DUSP6 is clinically associated with the aggressive\\n\\n321 HER2+ breast cancer but may also have a broader role in defining breast cancer\\n\\n322 subtype development.\\n\\n323\\n\\n324 **DUSP6 promotes the HER2i tolerance and DTP-DTEP transition under**\\n\\n325 **continuous lapatinib treatment**\\n\\n326\\n\\n327 Clinical relevance of DUSP6 in HER2+ breast cancers among the four candidate\\n\\n328 phosphatases differentially regulated at DTP-DTEP transition, together with the\\n\\n329 feasibility of DUSP6 targeting by small molecules (Kong et al., 2023; Korotchenko et\\n\\n330 _al., 2014; Molina et al., 2009; Vainonen et al., 2021; Zandi et al., 2022), motivated us_\\n\\n331 to select DUSP6 as the phosphatase to be focused in this study. We confirmed\\n\\n332 differential expression of DUSP6 across different resistance acquisition transitions in\\n\\n333 BT474 cells. Consistent with the RNA sequencing results (Fig. 2C), DUSP6 protein\\n\\n334 expression was strongly induced upon the DTP-DTEP transition (Fig. 3A). While the\\n\\n335 _DUSP6 mRNA levels were diminished in the fully resistant LR clones compared to_\\n\\n336 DTEPs (Fig. 2C), its protein levels remained robustly elevated presumably via post\\n337 translational stabilization mechanisms (Fig. 3A). Validating that these effects were\\n\\n338 not cell line specific, DUSP6 protein was also increased in BT474BrLR cells as\\n\\n339 compared to the parental cells (Appendix Figure 3A). We further validated inhibition\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n340 of DUSP6 upon DTP phase across independent set of lapatinib treated HER2+ cells\\n\\n341 including BT474Br, and two cell lines (EFM192A, HCC1419) from (Data ref:(Chang\\n\\n342 _et al., 2022)( GSE155342), or NSCLC, melanoma, and colorectal cancer cells_ _de_\\n\\n343 _novo treated with various TKIs (Fig. 3B). Therefore, inhibition of DUSP6 expression_\\n\\n344 appears as a general mechanism associated with establishment of TKI-induced\\n\\n345 therapy tolerance. Selected E2F1 and FOXM1 target genes were also confirmed to\\n\\n346 be downregulated in TKI-treated NSCLC, MM, and CRC DTP cells (Appendix Figure\\n\\n347 S3B). Notably, among the transcription factors differentially implicated upon HER2i\\n\\n348 tolerance development (Fig. 1B), forkhead box transcription factor M1 (FOXM1) and\\n\\n349 NFYA bind to DUSP6 promoter (Dataset EV4), and coinciding with _DUSP6_\\n\\n350 expression, FOXM1 gene expression is downregulated in DTPs and upregulated in\\n\\n351 DTEPs (Appendix Figure S3C). Functionally, a small molecule inhibitor of FOXM1\\n\\n352 (FDI-6) (Wang et al, 2021) inhibited DUSP6 expression in a time-dependent fashion\\n\\n353 in BT474 cells (Appendix Figure S3D,E). Together with its role as breast cancer\\n\\n354 oncogene involved in therapy resistance (Zhang et al, 2021), these data imply\\n\\n355 FOXM1 as a viable candidate inducing _DUSP6 expression during the DTP-DTEP_\\n\\n356 transition.\\n\\n357\\n\\n358 To evaluate whether the hallmark gene sets co-regulated with DUSP6 during therapy\\n\\n359 tolerance transitions (Fig. 1C) could be functionally downstream of DUSP6, we\\n\\n360 performed a RNAseq analysis from _DUSP6 depleted MDA-MB-453 cells and_\\n\\n361 compared these two gene sets. Notably, there was a marked overlap between\\n\\n362 hallmark gene sets from these two conditions in which DUSP6 expression was\\n\\n363 suppressed (Fig. 1C versus Fig. 3C; overlapping gene sets highlighted in red).\\n\\n364 Especially interesting finding was that the DUSP6 knockdown cells displayed a gene\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n365 expression pattern linked to dormant cancer cells such as inhibition of MYC, E2F1\\n\\n366 targets, and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, as well as activation of the interferon\\n\\n367 response (Chang et al., 2022; Dhimolea et al., 2021; Kurppa et al., 2020; Marine et\\n\\n368 _al., 2020). The finding that siRNA-mediated DUSP6 depletion (Fig. 3C) recapitulates_\\n\\n369 the gene expression profile in the lapatinib-induced DTP cells (Fig. 1C), clearly\\n\\n370 indicates that inhibition of DUSP6-driven gene expression programs functionally\\n\\n371 contribute to the HER2i-elicited growth inhibition.\\n\\n372\\n\\n373\\n\\n374 To functionally validate that increased DUSP6 expression in DTEP cells contributes\\n\\n375 to their survival, we ectopically overexpressed DUSP6 in BT474 cells, and subjected\\n\\n376 the cells to treatment with lapatinib, neratinib, afatinib, or tucatinib. Importantly,\\n\\n377 DUSP6 overexpression was able to dampen both cell viability inhibition, and\\n\\n378 apoptosis induction, by all four tested HER2is (Fig. 3D,E and Figure EV3A-D).\\n\\n379 Mechanistically, the anti-apoptotic activity of DUSP6 in lapatinib treated BT474 cells\\n\\n380 appeared to be independent of ERK MAPK regulation, as overexpression of the KIM\\n\\n381 mutant of DUSP6 (R64A,R65A), incapable in ERK binding (Nichols et al, 2000), had\\n\\n382 equally strong impact as the wild-type DUSP6 (Fig. 3F and Appendix Figure S3F).\\n\\n383 ERK-independent antiapoptotic activity for DUSP6 in cancer cells was suggested\\n\\n384 also recently (Kong et al., 2023). As a complementary pharmacological approach,\\n\\n385 BT474 cells were treated with lapatinib or neratinib alone, or in combination with\\n\\n386 small molecule DUSP6 inhibitor BCI for 6 months. BCI is a semi-allosteric inhibitor of\\n\\n387 both DUSP1 and DUSP6 and several studies have demonstrated that BCI\\n\\n388 phenocopies genetic DUSP6 inhibition in cancer (Kong et al., 2023; Ramkissoon et\\n\\n389 _al, 2019; Shojaee et al., 2015). Notably, as compared to the monotherapies,_\\n\\n390 combination with BCI preempted the DTEP development in both lapatinib and\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n391 neratinib treated cells (Fig. 3G). Strongly indicative of selective drug interaction\\n\\n392 rather than overall toxicity by BCI, the BCI used at the given concentration for 6\\n\\n393 months did not kill all BT474 cells but potently synergized with the HER2is (Fig. 3G).\\n\\n394 The fact that DUSP6 overexpression inhibited HER2i-elicited cell killing (Fig. 3E),\\n\\n395 whereas BCI abrogated development of HER2i tolerant cells (Fig. 3G), strongly\\n\\n396 support selective effects for BCI on DUSP6. Indeed, the role of DUSP1 as a primary\\n\\n397 BCI target was overruled by the results that DUSP1 was neither expressed at the\\n\\n398 protein level in BT474 cells (Fig. 3A), nor its mRNA was found differentially regulated\\n\\n399 between any of the acquired resistance phases (Fig. 2A, B, Dataset EV1). In\\n\\n400 harmony, DUSP1 overexpression had clearly weaker activity than DUSP6\\n\\n401 overexpression in the rescue experiments (Figure EV3D). To further validate the\\n\\n402 selectivity of BCI as a DUSP6 inhibitor, we generated DUSP6 knockout (DUSP6KO)\\n\\n403 MDA-MB-453 cells by CRISPR/CAS9 (Appendix Figure S3G). Indeed, three\\n\\n404 independent single cell clones of DUSP6KO cells were significantly less sensitive to\\n\\n405 BCI-elicited inhibition of cell viability as compared to the control cells (Appendix\\n\\n406 Figure S3H).\\n\\n407\\n\\n408 Collectively, these results identify DUSP6 downregulation to be functionally relevant\\n\\n409 for establishment of the DTP phase, whereas its transcriptional induction contributes\\n\\n410 to DTP-DTEP transition in lapatinib treated HER2+ cells.\\n\\n411\\n\\n412 **DUSP6 targeting kills HER2i resistant breast cancer cells and synergizes with**\\n\\n413 **HER2i combination therapies**\\n\\n414\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n415 After discovering the role for DUSP6 in the development of HER2i tolerance, we\\n\\n416 wanted to address its role in HER2+ breast cancer cells with stable HER2i\\n\\n417 resistance. To this end, we compared pharmacological DUSP6 targeting against a\\n\\n418 library of available small molecule modulators of other phosphatases (Lazo et al.,\\n\\n419 2018; Vainonen et al., 2021). Across either HER2i resistant cells lines, inhibition of\\n\\n420 cell viability by phosphatase targeting was observed only with DUSP6 inhibitor BCI,\\n\\n421 its derivative BCI-215, and with FTY-720 that reactivates protein phosphatase 2A\\n\\n422 (PP2A) by SET inhibition (Saddoughi et al, 2013)(Figure EV4). The phenocopying\\n\\n423 results between BCI and BCI-215 is an important additional evidence for the\\n\\n424 selectivity of BCI type of drugs towards DUSPs, as BCI-215 was demonstrated to\\n\\n425 activate only the DUSP1 and 6 target MAPKs among the 43 tested kinases (Chan et\\n\\n426 _al, 2020; Kaltenmeier et al, 2017). Based on the response to kinase inhibitors and_\\n\\n427 anti-apoptotic antagonists, the cells that are HER2i resistant, but sensitive to DUSP6\\n\\n428 inhibition, are co-dependent on PI3K/AKT, PLK1 and AXL kinase activities, and on\\n\\n429 the anti-apoptotic proteins IkB, survivin, cIAP and/or XIAP (Figure EV4). Further\\n\\n430 corroborating the role for DUSP6 as the anti-apoptotic target in stably HER2i\\n\\n431 resistance cells, siRNA-mediated depletion of _DUSP6 induced apoptosis in MDA-_\\n\\n432 MB-453 cells (Fig. 4A). This was not seen with DUSP1 inhibition (Fig. 4A). DUSP6\\n\\n433 depletion also induced apoptosis in another HER2i resistant HER2+ cell line MDA\\n434 MB-361 (Appendix Figure S4A). Furthermore, independent clones of CRISPR/CAS9\\n\\n435 targeted MDA-MB-453 _DUSP6 KO cells showed impaired long-term colony growth_\\n\\n436 potential (Fig. 4B). This was due to loss of DUSP6 expression, as lentiviral re\\n437 expression of DUSP6 rescued the phenotype (Appendix Figure S4B-E).\\n\\n438\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n439 Notably, the genetic DUSP6 targeting also sensitized MDA-MB-453 cells to several\\n\\n440 HER2 targeting approaches. Indeed, whereas the parental MDA-MB-453 cells were\\n\\n441 resistant to the clinically relevant concentrations of lapatinib, neratinib and\\n\\n442 trastuzumab, this resistance was abrogated in the DUSP6-siRNA targeted cells (Fig.\\n\\n443 4C, Appendix Figure S4F). These results also validate that DUSP6 inhibition\\n\\n444 sensitizes to HER2 inhibition regardless of whether small molecule inhibitors or\\n\\n445 therapeutic antibody (trastuzumab) is used. The impact of genetic DUSP6 targeting\\n\\n446 in HER2i sensitization was recapitulated by BCI treatment (Fig. 4D). Additionally,\\n\\n447 _DUSP6 depletion increased sensitivity to the combination of neratinib and_\\n\\n448 capecitabine (Fig. 4E), which is a combination therapy in clinical use (Saura et al,\\n\\n449 2020). Furthermore, _DUSP6 depletion enhanced sensitivity to the combination of_\\n\\n450 tucatinib+trastuzumab+capecitabine (Appendix Figure S4G), which improves\\n\\n451 progression free survival and overall survival in patients with HER2+ metastatic\\n\\n452 breast cancer (Murthy et al, 2020).\\n\\n453\\n\\n454 Together with DUSP6 overexpression experiments in HER2i sensitive cells (Fig. 3G\\n455 I), these data provide strong evidence that DUSP6 contributes to the HER2i\\n\\n456 resistance both in monotherapy and combination therapy settings.\\n\\n457\\n\\n458 **DUSP6 inhibition overcomes HER2 inhibitor resistance in vivo**\\n\\n459\\n\\n460 To validate the _in vivo_ relevance of the results, we used both genetic and\\n\\n461 pharmacological targeting of DUSP6 in HER2i resistant xenograft models. To start\\n\\n462 with, we evaluated the impact of CRISPR/CAS9-mediated _DUSP6 knockout on the_\\n\\n463 xenograft growth of MDA-MB-453 cells in immunocompromised BALB/cOlaHsd\\n\\n-----\\n\\n464 Foxn1nu mice. Importantly, the two _DUSP6 KO clones showed significant and_\\n\\n465 indistinguishable antitumor effects as compared to the control cells (Fig. 5A). Next,\\n\\n466 we asked whether pharmacological DUSP6 blockade overcomes HER2i resistance\\n\\n467 _in vivo. For this purpose, we used two different HER2+ cell models, MDA-MB-453 or_\\n\\n468 HCC1954. When xenografts with these two cell lines had reached the approximate\\n\\n469 size of 100 mm[3], the mice were randomized into four treatment groups; vehicle,\\n\\n470 lapatinib/neratinib (50 mg/kg), BCI (50 mg/kg), and lapatinib/neratinib+BCI.\\n\\n471 Importantly, validating the _in vivo HER2i resistance of both chosen HER2+ cell_\\n\\n472 models, tumors from both cell lines were fully resistant to clinically relevant doses of\\n\\n473 either lapatinib or neratinib (Fig. 5B-E). Notably, both MDA-MB-453 and HCC1954\\n\\n474 tumors also displayed strong resistance to BCI monotherapy (Fig. 5B-E), indicating\\n\\n475 for tumor microenvironment-mediated impact as compared to the _in vitro cultures._\\n\\n476 However, combination of BCI very efficiently preempted the lapatinib or neratinib\\n\\n477 resistance phenotype (Fig. 5B-E). Indicating for potential clinical utility, DUSP6 and\\n\\n478 HER2-targeted therapies displayed a clear synthetic lethal drug interaction when\\n\\n479 assessed by a waterfall blot in both cell models (Fig. 5C, E). The dramatic\\n\\n480 combinatorial activity of DUSP6 and HER2 targeting on cellular viability was also\\n\\n481 evidenced by lack of cytoplasmic eosin staining of the MDA-MB-453 xenograft tumor\\n\\n482 after 24 d of treatment (Fig. 5F). Consistent with previous studies with BCI\\n\\n483 (Kesarwani et al, 2017; Ramkissoon et al., 2019; Shojaee et al., 2015; Wu et al.,\\n\\n484 2018), we did not observe any apparent signs of toxicity or weight loss (Appendix\\n\\n485 Figure S4D) in any treatment groups. In addition, normal fibroblasts displayed\\n\\n486 several folds decreased sensitivity to BCI in an in vitro cell viability assay (Appendix\\n\\n487 Figure S4E), further indicating for a favorable dose-window between impact of\\n\\n488 DUSP6 inhibition in HER2i resistance, and its effects to normal cells.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n489\\n\\n490 **DUSP6 targeting does not lead to the compensatory HER3 induction**\\n\\n491 **characteristic to AKT inhibition**\\n\\n492\\n\\n493 Constitutive activity of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is strongly associated with\\n\\n494 HER2i therapy resistance (Berns et al, 2007; Majewski et al, 2015; Nagata et al,\\n\\n495 2004). Further, clinical studies of HER2i plus PI3K/AKT inhibitors demonstrated\\n\\n496 some clinical activity, but did not lead to approval of these combinations (Hudis et al,\\n\\n497 2013; Saura et al, 2014). On the other hand, PI3K/AKT activation was one of the\\n\\n498 DUSP6-driven hallmark gene sets associated with the DTP-DTEP transition (Fig. 1C\\n\\n499 and 3F). Therefore, it was relevant to compare the quantitative and qualitative\\n\\n500 differences between DUSP6 blockade versus AKT inhibition in combination with the\\n\\n501 HER2i in the resistant models. Having demonstrated phenocopying growth effects\\n\\n502 between genetic DUSP6 inhibition and BCI, as well as resistance of DUSP KO cells\\n\\n503 to BCI, these experiments were mostly performed by comparing the compounds\\n\\n504 MK2206 (AKTi) and BCI (DUSP6i) as the alternative pharmacological HER2i\\n\\n505 combination approaches.\\n\\n506\\n\\n507 In cell viability assay, both BCI and MK2206 synergized with already low micromolar\\n\\n508 concentrations of lapatinib and neratinib in MDA-MB-453 and HCC1954 cells,\\n\\n509 respectively (Fig. 6A,B, and Appendix Figures S4C and S5A). However, as\\n\\n510 compared to AKT inhibition, DUSP6 targeting had qualitatively superior pro-apoptotic\\n\\n511 activity. Regardless of efficient inhibition of AKT phosphorylation, MK2206 did not\\n\\n512 induce apoptosis alone, or in combination with lapatinib (Fig. 6C,D). In contrast,\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n513 treatment with BCI plus lapatinib triggered apoptosis across all the tested cell models\\n\\n514 (Fig. 6C,D, and Appendix Figure S5B).\\n\\n515\\n\\n516 HER3 is a key pro-survival receptor in HER2+ breast cancer cells (Haikala & Janne,\\n\\n517 2021). Further, compensatory induction of HER3 is thought to be one of the primary\\n\\n518 mechanisms behind the resistance to the combination of HER2 inhibition and AKT\\n\\n519 targeting (Chandarlapaty et al, 2011; Wilson et al., 2012). Accordingly, AKT inhibition\\n\\n520 resulted in HER3 induction in MDA-MBA-453 cells treated with either MK2206 alone,\\n\\n521 and with MK2206-lapatinib combination (Fig. 6C,E). Pharmacological inhibition of the\\n\\n522 AKT upstream kinase PI3K also induced HER3 expression (Appendix Figure S5C).\\n\\n523 In contrast, BCI decreased HER2 and HER3 expressions as a monotherapy, and in\\n\\n524 combination with lapatinib (Fig. 6C, F). Notably, both HER2 and HER3 were\\n\\n525 downregulated 3 h already after BCI treatment, and this coincided with the induction\\n\\n526 of ERK phosphorylation, and destabilization of DUSP6, both serving as signs for BCI\\n\\n527 target engagement (Fig. 6G). Accordingly, siRNA-mediated knockdown of _DUSP6_\\n\\n528 reduced HER2 and HER3 protein levels in MDA-MB-453, HCC1954, and the HER3+\\n\\n529 triple negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 (Fig. 6H and Appendix Figures\\n\\n530 S5D,E). Indicative of transcriptional regulation, _DUSP6 inhibition decreased_ _HER2_\\n\\n531 and _HER3 mRNA expression, but did not impact HER2 and HER3 protein stability_\\n\\n532 (Appendix Figure S5F,G). Further, indicative of selective effects on HER2 and HER3\\n\\n533 among the ERBB receptors, EGFR expression was unaffected by DUSP6 targeting\\n\\n534 in MDA-MB-468 (Appendix Figure S5E). The tumor material from the BCI-treated\\n\\n535 MDA-MB-453 xenograft model was further used for _in vivo_ validation of HER3 as\\n\\n536 DUSP6 downstream target. Indeed, BCI-treated tumors displayed vastly decreased\\n\\n537 tumor cell immunopositivity for HER3, and to lesser extent HER2 (Fig. 6I). Finally,\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n538 clinically high _DUSP6_ tumors had significantly higher expression of tyrosine 1298\\n\\n539 phosphorylated HER3 (Fig. 6J).\\n\\n540\\n\\n541 These findings indicate that when HER2i is combined AKTi, the HER2+ cells survive\\n\\n542 due to compensatory induction of HER3, whereas DUSP6 blockade rather inhibits\\n\\n543 HER3, and therefore BCI+lapatinib treated cells succumb to apoptosis.\\n\\n544\\n\\n545 **DUSP6 targeting overcomes NRG-mediated HER2i therapy tolerance**\\n\\n546\\n\\n547 HER3 is activated in tumors by tumor microenvironment derived ligand NRG, and\\n\\n548 NRG-activated HER3 drives HER2i tolerance (Kodack et al, 2017; Leung et al,\\n\\n549 2015). On the other hand, our results indicate that DUSP6 may drive HER2i\\n\\n550 resistance by promoting the expression of HER3. With this background, we\\n\\n551 compared the capacity of DUSP6 and AKT inhibition to reverse HER2i tolerance by\\n\\n552 the NRG/HER3 axis. As expected, (Kodack et al., 2017; Leung et al., 2015), NRG\\n\\n553 treatment induced tolerance to both neratinib and lapatinib across all four tested\\n\\n554 primarily sensitive cell lines (Fig. 7A and Appendix Figure S6A). The NRG-mediated\\n\\n555 rescue from both HER2is was abrogated in a concentration dependent manner after\\n\\n556 treatment with BCI, but not with MK2206 (Fig. 7A and Appendix Figure S6A). The\\n\\n557 only exception was HCC2218 cells, in which also MK2206 reversed NRG-elicited\\n\\n558 HER2i tolerance (Fig. 7A and Appendix Figure S6A). These results were validated at\\n\\n559 the level of differential apoptosis induction between DUSP6 and AKT targeting.\\n\\n560 Whereas NRG completely prevented HER2i-elicited induction of apoptosis in BT474\\n\\n561 cells, and AKT inhibition could not reverse this, DUSP6 inhibition restored the\\n\\n562 apoptotic activity (Fig. 7B). On the other hand, RNAi-mediated _HER3 knockdown_\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n563 triggered apoptosis in MDA-MB-453 cells (Appendix Figure S6B). To functionally\\n\\n564 prove that inhibition of _HER3 expression mediates BCI effects, we performed a_\\n\\n565 rescue experiment in MDA-MB-453 cells with ectopic stable overexpression of HER3\\n\\n566 under heterologous CMV promoter (Appendix Figure S6C). As compared to control\\n\\n567 cells, the HER3 overexpressing cells displayed significant resistance to BCI (Fig.\\n\\n568 7C).\\n\\n569\\n\\n570 To link these results back to the development of HER2i tolerance, we found that\\n\\n571 targeting of DUSP6, but not AKT, reversed the NRG-elicited effects on lapatinib\\n\\n572 tolerance in the DTP assay (Fig. 7D). This BCI effect was likely due to DUSP6\\n\\n573 inhibition, as siRNA-mediated _DUSP6 depletion also abrogated the NRG-induced_\\n\\n574 cell survival in BT474 cells (Appendix Figure S6D). Importantly, deregulation of\\n\\n575 NRG-ERBB axis was evidenced also during the DTP-DTEP transition of lapatinib\\n\\n576 treated cells as, concomitantly with DUSP6 regulation (Fig. 2C), NRG3 and ERBB4\\n\\n577 were found upregulated in DTEP versus DTP cells (Appendix Figure S6E). Further,\\n\\n578 providing clinical validation for the link between NRG and DUSP6, NRG mRNA was\\n\\n579 significantly overexpressed in breast tumors with high _DUSP6_ mRNA expression\\n\\n580 (Fig. 7E).\\n\\n581\\n\\n582 Due to brain microenvironment derived NRG, HER3 has a key role in brain\\n\\n583 metastatic growth of HER2+ breast cancers (Da Silva et al, 2010; Haikala & Janne,\\n\\n584 2021). Based on the newly discovered role for DUSP6 in promoting HER3\\n\\n585 expression, we investigated contribution of DUSP6 in the brain metastatic outgrowth\\n\\n586 by using GFP-positive MDA-MB-361 cells as yet additional HER2+ in _vivo model. To_\\n\\n587 this end, we quantitated the zebrafish intracranial tumor area derived from GFP+\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n588 MDA-MB-361 cells transfected prior tumor implantation either with control or DUSP6\\n\\n589 targeting siRNA. As shown in Fig. 7F, the zebrafish larva with DUSP6 targeted cells\\n\\n590 had significantly smaller tumors 3d after the intracranial injection. Further, mice\\n\\n591 bearing the intracranial _DUSP6 KO MDA-MB-453 tumors had a significantly longer_\\n\\n592 survival time as compared with the CAS9 control group (Fig. 7G).\\n\\n593\\n\\n594 Collectively these results demonstrate that DUSP6 inhibition is superior to AKT\\n\\n595 blockade as a HER2i combination therapy strategy due to its newly discovered\\n\\n596 capacity to inhibit the NRG-HER3 axis and has potential in inhibiting brain metastatic\\n\\n597 growth of HER2+ cells.\\n\\n598\\n\\n599 **A DUSP6-HER3 feed forward loop drives the HER2i tolerance**\\n\\n600\\n\\n601 After identifying previously unrecognized regulation of HER3 by DUSP6 and\\n\\n602 demonstrating its functional relevance, we asked whether the HER3 reciprocally\\n\\n603 regulates DUSP6 expression. Indeed, _DUSP6 mRNA expression was potently_\\n\\n604 inhibited already with the smallest tested concentration of neratinib or lapatinib in the\\n\\n605 HER2i sensitive cells (BT474, BT474Br) (Fig. 8A and Appendix Figure S7A; in\\n\\n606 green). However, among the HER2i resistant cell lines, DUSP6 was not inhibited by\\n\\n607 HER2is in MDA-MB-361, MDA-MB-453, BT474Br-LR, and BT474-LR cells, whereas\\n\\n608 HCC1954 showed an intermediate phenotype (Fig. 8A and Appendix Figure S7A; in\\n\\n609 red). Additionally, this regulation was specific to _DUSP6, as_ _DUSP1_ mRNA\\n\\n610 expression was not inhibited by HER2 targeting in any of the tested cell modes (Fig.\\n\\n611 8A and Appendix Figure S7A). Clinically DUSP6 and HER3 mRNA expression also\\n\\n612 correlated in HER2+ cancer samples in the TCGA-BRCA dataset (Cerami et al.,\\n\\n613 2012)(Appendix Figure S7B). Differential regulation of DUSP6 expression by HER2i\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n614 in sensitive (BT474Br, BT474) versus resistant (MDA-MB-361, MDA-MB-453,\\n\\n615 BT474BrLR) cells was validated at the protein level by western blotting (Fig. 8B,C\\n\\n616 and Figure EV5). Importantly, RNAi-mediated knockdown of _HER3_ decreased\\n\\n617 DUSP6 expression (Fig. 8D). HER3 dependent DUSP6 regulation was further\\n\\n618 supported by induction of _DUSP6 mRNA and protein expression by treatment of_\\n\\n619 serum-starved BT474 or BT474Br cells with the HER3 ligand NRG (Fig. 8E, F and\\n\\n620 Appendix Figures S7C,D). Induction of DUSP6 was selective for NRG, since\\n\\n621 hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which activates MET RTK, failed to increase\\n\\n622 DUSP6 in BT474 cells (Appendix Figure S7C,D). To gain insights into the\\n\\n623 mechanism by which HER3 regulates DUSP6, the NRG treated cells were co-treated\\n\\n624 either with AKTi MK2206, or the MEK1/2 inhibitor trametinib. Consistent with a\\n\\n625 previous report that DUSP6 is a transcriptional ERK1/2 target (Zandi et al., 2022),\\n\\n626 treatment with trametinib inhibited both ERK phosphorylation and DUSP6 expression\\n\\n627 in all tested cell lines (Fig. 8E-G and Appendix Figure S7E), whereas AKT inhibition\\n\\n628 by MK2206 further increased DUSP6 expression (Fig. 8E-G). Notably, HER2i\\n629 elicited inhibition of DUSP6 expression correlated with the capability of HER2i to\\n\\n630 impact ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 8F, G and Figure EV5A,B).\\n\\n631\\n\\n632 Collectively these results reveal that inhibition of the newly discovered DUSP6-HER3\\n\\n633 feed-forward loop has a major contribution to HER2i therapy response, and that lack\\n\\n634 of DUSP6 inhibition is a novel HER2i resistance mechanism in acquired resistant\\n\\n635 cells in which HER2i fails to target MEK activity (Fig. 8H).\\n\\n636\\n\\n637\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n638 **Discussion**\\n\\n639\\n\\n640 Cancer therapy resistance is initiated by non-genetic signaling rewiring resulting in\\n\\n641 major changes in the epigenetic and transcriptional landscapes of DTPs (Chang et\\n\\n642 _al., 2022; De Conti et al., 2021; Marine et al., 2020; Sharma et al., 2010). It is_\\n\\n643 commonly believed that transition from dormant DTPs to proliferating DTEPs is a\\n\\n644 pivotal step towards development of the disseminated disease, and eventually late\\n645 stage genetic changes which determine the ultimate therapy resistance (Aguirre\\n646 Ghiso, 2021; Marine et al., 2020). Here, we report the first transcriptomic analysis of\\n\\n647 the DTP-DTEP transition in TKI treated cancer cells. In addition to importance of the\\n\\n648 discovery of the role of DUSP6 in DTP-DTEP transition, the transcriptome data will\\n\\n649 provide a rich resource for future studies to understand different stages of the HER2i\\n\\n650 resistance development. Based on the fuzzy clustering data (Appendix figure S1 and\\n\\n651 Dataset EV2), the gene clusters 1, 2 and 6, contain genes that are strongly regulated\\n\\n652 upon the DTP-DTEP transition and are therefore contain many additional genes\\n\\n653 involved in the evasion of the DTP cells from lapatinib-induced growth inhibition. The\\n\\n654 longitudinal transcriptomics profiles also allowed us to identify potential master\\n\\n655 transcription factors involved in the lapatinib resistance development. The functional\\n\\n656 relevance of the differentially expressed genes associated with each therapy\\n\\n657 tolerance transition obviously need to be validated in future studies stemming from\\n\\n658 this novel resource. Further, to understand therapy tolerance development\\n\\n659 projectories at the single cell level, similar studies are needed by employing single\\n\\n660 cell RNA sequencing technologies.\\n\\n661\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n662 Phosphatases have recently emerged as novel druggable targets for cancer therapy\\n\\n663 (Lazo et al., 2018; Vainonen et al., 2021; Zandi et al., 2022). However, their\\n\\n664 contribution to development of non-genetic TKI therapy tolerance is still poorly\\n\\n665 understood. In the present study, we asked which phosphatases might contribute to\\n\\n666 the development of HER2i tolerance and resistance and explored their potential role\\n\\n667 as therapy targets in combination with the HER2i therapies in HER2+ breast cancer.\\n\\n668 Via transcriptomics analysis of lapatinib tolerance development over six months, we\\n\\n669 discovered an important role for DUSP6 in the re-growth of HER2i tolerant cells and\\n\\n670 showed that its genetic and pharmacological blockade potentiates HER2i sensitivity\\n\\n671 _in vitro and_ _in vivo in multiple different HER2+ cell models. Mechanistically, we_\\n\\n672 discovered that transcriptional _DUSP6_ inhibition is an important contributor to\\n\\n673 effective HER2i response whereas the lack of HER2i-elicited DUSP6 inhibition in the\\n\\n674 resistant cells provides a novel explanation for drug resistance in these cells (Fig.\\n\\n675 8H). We further discovered DUSP6 as a novel activator of _HER3 expression and_\\n\\n676 demonstrated that _HER3_ inhibition is a prerequisite for the therapeutic impact of\\n\\n677 DUSP6 inhibition. Inhibition of HER3 by DUSP6 targeting appears also an important\\n\\n678 mechanistic explanation for the superior apoptotic activity as compared to PI3K/AKT\\n\\n679 targeting in combination with HER2i. As we demonstrate, the therapeutic impact of\\n\\n680 DUSP6 targeting is not compromised by the NRG-mediated feedback to HER3 as is\\n\\n681 the case with AKT targeting and thereby our data identify DUSP6 targeting as a\\n\\n682 novel approach to target NRG-HER3 axis to overcome HER2i resistance. These are\\n\\n683 important advantages favoring DUSP6 blockade versus AKT inhibition as a future\\n\\n684 strategy for treatment of HER2+ breast cancer. A particularly important translational\\n\\n685 finding in our study is that DUSP6 defines therapy sensitivity of the lapatinib resistant\\n\\n686 cells in response to several ERBB TKIs with different specificities, and to their\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n687 chemotherapy combinations. This is consistent with the proposed HER3-DUSP6\\n\\n688 positive feedback mechanism, as HER3 or NRG overexpression confer resistance to\\n\\n689 several cancer drugs (Erjala et al., 2006; Haikala & Janne, 2021; Knuefermann et\\n\\n690 _al., 2003; Recondo et al., 2020; Wilson et al., 2012; Yonesaka et al., 2011). Thereby_\\n\\n691 identification of DUSP6 targeting as a novel approach for HER3 inhibition may have\\n\\n692 broad ramifications in different combination therapy settings across different cancer\\n\\n693 types. HER2 and 3 play also essential roles in the development of brain metastasis\\n\\n694 which causes death of more than 30% of stage IV HER2+ breast cancer patients\\n\\n695 (Berghoff et al, 2014; Da Silva et al., 2010; Fecci et al., 2019). To this end, DUSP6\\n696 mediated regulation of HER2 and 3 suggested that its inhibition may retard\\n\\n697 development of brain metastasis. Indeed, our findings directly support these\\n\\n698 conclusions as _DUSP6 knockout in tumor cells improves survival of mice with_\\n\\n699 intracranial HER2+ tumors and the outgrowth of HER2+ breast tumor cells in a\\n\\n700 zebrafish intracranial model. Linking our results further to future therapy of HER2+\\n\\n701 brain metastasis, we showed that _DUSP6 knockdown increases sensitivity to_\\n\\n702 tucatinib+trastuzumab+capecitabine combination regimen, which show significant\\n\\n703 clinical activity in HER2+ breast cancer patients with brain metastasis (Murthy et al.,\\n\\n704 2020).\\n\\n705\\n\\n706 While demonstrated here for the first time in the context of HER2i therapy resistance,\\n\\n707 genetic DUSP6 inhibition has recently been shown to inhibit malignant phenotypes in\\n\\n708 other cancer types (Shojaee et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2018; Zandi et al., 2022).\\n\\n709 Consistent with these reports, genetic inhibition of _DUSP6 in our study resulted in_\\n\\n710 significant inhibition of HER2+ breast cancer cell viability, HER2i resistance, colony\\n\\n711 forming potential, and _in vivo tumor growth. Mechanistically, DUSP6 inhibition_\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n712 converted cytostatic response to HER2i to an apoptotic response, which is\\n\\n713 considered as a paramount for cancer therapy strategies aiming for cancer cure. On\\n\\n714 the other hand, overexpression of DUSP6 converted HER2i sensitive cells to\\n\\n715 resistant in both cell viability and apoptosis assays. Importantly, all our main\\n\\n716 conclusions remained valid regardless of whether DUSP6 was inhibited either by\\n\\n717 siRNA, CRISPR/CAS9, or by pharmacological inhibitors BCI and BCI-215. We\\n\\n718 further demonstrated nearly immediate target engagement, as well as resistance of\\n\\n719 three independent _DUSP6 knock-out clones to BCI-elicited cell viability inhibition._\\n\\n720 Therefore, together with recent results from the others (Kong et al., 2023; Shojaee et\\n\\n721 _al., 2015), we are confident that the results achieved by BCI and BCI-215 are_\\n\\n722 dependent on their inhibitory effects on DUSP6 despite a recent report questioned\\n\\n723 their selectivity using other cellular system (Thompson et al, 2022).\\n\\n724\\n\\n725 The results identified DUSP6 as a novel combination therapy target with existing\\n\\n726 clinical HER2 targeting strategies including both small molecule and antibody\\n\\n727 mediated HER2 inhibition and chemotherapy combinations. In that regard, our\\n\\n728 xenograft results demonstrate significant potential for pharmacological DUSP6\\n\\n729 inhibition in overcoming HER2i resistance _in vivo by using two different HER2i_\\n\\n730 resistant cell lines, and two different HER2is. Whereas neither HER2 nor DUSP6\\n\\n731 inhibition alone did not have therapeutic effect on tumors, the combination showed\\n\\n732 very potent synthetic lethal phenotype further validating our in vitro results. The lack\\n\\n733 of monotherapy effect of BCI, combined with clear evidence for downstream target\\n\\n734 mechanism engagement _in vivo also alleviates concerns about overall cellular_\\n\\n735 toxicity behind the BCI-elicited HER2i synergy. This is consistent with previous\\n\\n736 findings demonstrating antitumor effects with BCI and BCI-215 without obvious\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n737 systemic toxicity in _in vivo models of gastric cancer, leukemia, and malignant_\\n\\n738 peripheral nerve sheath tumor (Kesarwani et al., 2017; Ramkissoon et al., 2019;\\n\\n739 Shojaee et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2018).\\n\\n740\\n\\n741 In summary, we provide first transcriptional map of DTP-DTEP transition under TKI\\n\\n742 tolerance development in cancer. The results specifically identify DUSP6 targeting\\n\\n743 as a novel approach to target HER3-mediated ERBB TKI resistance. Ultimately, the\\n\\n744 work provides proof-of-principle evidence to encourage development of next\\n\\n745 generation DUSP6 inhibitors (with brain penetrance) to test the clinical relevance of\\n\\n746 the presented therapy scenarios.\\n\\n747\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n748 **Materials and Methods**\\n\\n749\\n\\n750 **Reagents**\\n\\n751 Tissue culture reagents including regular RPMI, DMEM, RPMI and FBS were\\n\\n752 purchased from Sigma. The recombinant NRG, HGF and Î²-estradiol (E2) were from\\n\\n753 Peprotech. BCI was purchased from Axon Medchem. BCI-215 was provided by Dr.\\n\\n754 Andreas Vogt, University of Pittsburgh Drug Discovery Institute, Pittsburgh, PA,\\n\\n755 USA. The HER2 inhibitors and the other compounds used in the drug screening\\n\\n756 were purchased from Adooq Bioscience. All the agents were dissolved in DMSO and\\n\\n757 the final concentration of DMSO did not exceed 0.1% [v/v] in all the treatments.\\n\\n758 **Cloning and plasmids**\\n\\n759 pBABE-puro-gateway-ERBB2 was a gift from Matthew Meyerson (Addgene plasmid\\n\\n760 No. 40978; http://n2t.net/addgene:40978; RRID:Addgene_40978). ERBB3 wild-type\\n\\n761 was cloned from pBABE-puro-gateway-ERBB3 (Koivu et al, 2021) into pLenti CMV\\n\\n762 Puro DEST (w118-1), a gift from Eric Campeau and Paul Kaufman (Addgene\\n\\n763 plasmid # 17452;http://n2t.net/addgene:17452 ; RRID:Addgene_17452) through\\n\\n764 Gateway cloning (Chakroborty et al, 2019) to create pLenti-CMV-Puro-ERBB3. The\\n\\n765 DUSP6 plasmid was purchased from Addgene (#27975) and the Kinase interaction\\n\\n766 motif (KIM) mutants were prepared by site directed mutagenesis (GenScript Inc)\\n\\n767 generating R64A, R65A double mutant defective in ERK binding as described\\n\\n768 (Nichols et al., 2000).\\n\\n769 **Generation of stable lines**\\n\\n770 To overexpress wild-type ERBB2, pBABE-puro-gateway-ERBB2 was transfected\\n\\n771 (using Fugene6 transfection reagent; Promega Catalog # E2692) into amphotropic\\n\\n772 Phoenix HEK293T cells (a gift from Dr. Garry Nolan) to generate retroviruses, which\\n\\n773 were used to transduce MDA-MB-453, as described previously (Chakroborty et al.,\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n774 2019). pLenti-CMV-Puro-ERBB3 was co-transfected with virus-packaging plasmids\\n\\n775 pMLDg/pRRE (addgene #12251), pMD2.G (addgene #12259), and pRSV-Rev\\n\\n776 (addgene #12253) into HEK293T cells using Fugene6 transfection reagent to\\n\\n777 produce lentiviruses. The lentivirus-containing supernatant was used to transduce\\n\\n778 MDA-MB-453 to over-express wild-type ERBB3. After viral transduction cells were\\n\\n779 treated with 1 Âµg/mL puromycin (Gibco) for 48 h to select the cells with stable\\n\\n780 expression of the respective introduced transgenes.\\n\\n781 For DUSP1 and 6 overexpression, lentiviral particles containing full length of either\\n\\n782 DUSP1 (Genecopoeia), DUSP6 (Addgene #27975), or control empty (Genecopoeia)\\n\\n783 vector were generated in HEK293FT packaging cell line (complete medium: high\\n\\n784 glucose DMEM, 10% FBS, 0,1mM NEAA, 1mM MEM Sodium Pyruvate, 6mM L\\n785 Glutamine, 1% Pen/Strep and 0,5mg/ml Geneticin) by transient transfection of\\n\\n786 transfer vector 2[nd] generation packaging plasmid-psPAX2 (Addgene #12259) and\\n\\n787 envelope vector-pMD2 (Addgene #12260) with the ratio (7:2:1) using calcium\\n788 phosphate precipitation method. Seventy-two hours post-transfection medium\\n\\n789 containing viral vectors was collected, concentrated for 2 h by ultracentrifugation in\\n\\n790 swing-out rotor SW-32Ti (Beckman Coulter), 26,000g, resuspended in residual\\n\\n791 medium and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Functional titer  Ì´1x10[8] was measured in\\n\\n792 HEK293FT cells and FACS (BD LSRFortessa, Becton Dickinson). To obtain stable\\n\\n793 overexpression of DUSP1, DUSP6 or double DUSP1+6 population on day zero,\\n\\n794 8x10[4] cells were seeded in a 24-well plate. 24 h later, the cells were transduced with\\n\\n795 MOI 60 of lentiviral stocks in a low volume of full media. Medium containing viral\\n\\n796 particles was removed 16 h later. Cells expressing DUSP1 and GFP indicative of\\n\\n797 lentiviral integration were collected by fluorescence assisted cell sorting (BD\\n\\n798 FACSaria II cell sorter, Becton Dickinson). FACS gating was set at 10% top high\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n799 fluorescence signal. DUSP6 transduced BT474 cells were selected with 3 Âµg/mL of\\n\\n800 puromycin. DUSP1 and 6 expressing cells were obtained by sequential transduction\\n\\n801 (MOI 2, 6, 10), puromycin selection and later GFP fluorescence assisted cell sorting\\n\\n802 (BD FACSaria II cell sorter, Becton Dickinson). The levels of protein were confirmed\\n\\n803 by Western blot analysis.\\n\\n804 For stable overexpression of DUSP6 and DUSP6 KIM mutant, DUSP6\\n\\n805 (Addgene #27975) and DUSP6[R64-65A ] lentiviral vectors were co-transfected with\\n\\n806 virus-packaging plasmids pMLDg/pRRE, (Addgene #12251), pMD2.G (Addgene\\n\\n807 #12259), and pRSV-Rev (Addgene #12253) into HEK293T cells using Fugene6\\n\\n808 transfection reagent to produce lentiviruses. 48 h after transfection viral supernatants\\n\\n809 were collected, filtered, and added to pre-plated BT474 cells along with 10 Î¼g/mL\\n\\n810 polybrene. Transduced cells were selected with 2 Î¼g/mL puromycin, and the protein\\n\\n811 levels were confirmed by Western blot analysis.\\n\\n812 To rescue the DUSP6 KO MDA-MB-453 clones, the pLEX307-hygro-DUSP6\\n\\n813 lentiviral vector was co-transfected with virus-packaging plasmids pMLDg/pRRE,\\n\\n814 (Addgene #12251), pMD2.G (Addgene #12259), and pRSV-Rev (Addgene #12253)\\n\\n815 into HEK293T cells using FuGENE6 transfection reagent. 48 hours after transfection\\n\\n816 viral supernatants were collected, filtered, and added to MDA-MB-453 DUSP6 KO\\n\\n817 cells (g1, clone 22) along with 10 Î¼g/mL polybrene. Transduced cells were selected\\n\\n818 with hygromycin (250Âµg/ml).The MDA-MB-453 CAS9 control, DUSP6 KO, and\\n\\n819 DUSP6 transduced KO cells were seeded at low density and maintained for 10 d.\\n\\n820 The colonies were stained with 0.5% crystal violet in methanol and imaged using an\\n\\n821 Epson scanner. Colony quantification was done by using the ImageJ ColonyArea\\n\\n822 plugin.\\n\\n823\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n824 **FACS**\\n\\n825 MDA-MB-453 cells transduced with lentiviruses encoding wild-type ERBB3 were\\n\\n826 washed with azide-free PBS, trypsinized and suspended in ice-cold sorting buffer\\n\\n827 (PBS +1% Goat serum, Life technologies catalog # PCN5000). The cells were\\n\\n828 incubated with anti-ERBB3 (MAB3481, R&D systems) for 1 h on ice, and with anti\\n829 mouse Alexa Fluor 405 (A-31553, Invitrogen) for 30 min on ice in a dark\\n\\n830 environment. Single cell suspension was analyzed and sorted on Sony SH800 Cell\\n\\n831 Sorter to select cell-pools with high surface ERBB3 expression.\\n\\n832 **CRISPR/CAS9 knockout system**\\n\\n833 A two-component CRISPR system was used to generate _DUSP6 KO cells (Adli,_\\n\\n834 2018). DUSP6 sgRNAs (seq#1- CATCGAGTCGGCCATCAACG, seq#2\\n835 GACTGGAACGAGAATACGGG, seq#3- CCATGATAGATACGCTCAGA) were\\n\\n836 selected using DeskGEN platform and cloned according to F. Zhang lab protocol.\\n\\n837 Separate lentivectors containing spCas9 (lentiCas9-Blast a gift from Feng Zhang\\n\\n838 (Addgene plasmid # 52962) and sgRNA (lentiGuide-Puro a gift from Feng Zhang\\n\\n839 (Addgene plasmid # 52963) were produced in HEK293FT packaging cell line by\\n\\n840 transient cotransfection. Shortly, 40-70% confluent HEK293FT cells were used for\\n\\n841 transfections with 14 Î¼g of transfer vector, 4 Î¼g of packaging vector psPAX2 (gift\\n\\n842 from Didier Trono (Addgene plasmid # 12260), 2 Î¼g envelope vector pMD2.G (gift\\n\\n843 from Didier Trono (Addgene plasmid # 12259) mixed in 0.45 mL water, 2.5M CaCl2,\\n\\n844 and 2x HeBS (274 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 1.4 mM Na2HPO4, 15 mM D-glucose, 42\\n\\n845 mM Hepes, pH 7.06) per 10 cm dish. Before adding to the cells, the DNA-HeBS mix\\n\\n846 was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After overnight incubation medium\\n\\n847 with DNA precipitate was gently removed from the cells and replaced with a full fresh\\n\\n848 medium. Media containing viral particles was collected after 72 h, spun at 300 rpm\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n849 for 5 min at room temperature to remove cell debris, filtered through 0.45 Âµm PES\\n\\n850 filter, and concentrated by ultracentrifugation for 2 hours at 25,000rpm, 4Â°C\\n\\n851 (Beckman Coulter). The pellet containing lentiviral particles was suspended in the\\n\\n852 residual medium, incubated for ~2 hours in +4ËC with occasional mild vortex,\\n\\n853 aliquoted, snap-frozen and stored in -70ËC. P24 ELISA measured physical lentiviral\\n\\n854 titer with a serial dilution of virus stock according to manufacturer protocol.\\n\\n855 To generate DUSP6KO clones in MDA-MB-453, 1e+05 cells were seeded on a 24\\n856 well plate. The next day the cells were transduced with Lenti-Cas9 (MOI 1, 5, 10),\\n\\n857 and 72 h later, 8 Î¼g/mL of Blasticidin was applied to select only Cas9 expressing\\n\\n858 cells. Cells transduced with the smallest number of Lenti-Cas9 particles that survived\\n\\n859 after the parallel control well was cleared proceeded to the next step. In the second\\n\\n860 stage, the mixed pool of stably expressing Cas9 cells was transduced with Lenti\\n\\n861 sgRNA vectors (MOI 5,10,15,20), and 72 h later, 1 Î¼g/uL Puromycin was applied on\\n\\n862 the cells to select double-positive Cas9+/Lenti sgRNA+ cells. Based on Western blot\\n\\n863 results, cell populations showing the highest reduction in DUSP6 protein levels were\\n\\n864 single sorted (Sony SH800 cell sorter, Sony Biotechnology Inc) and re-grown into a\\n\\n865 clonal cell population. On average, about 20 clones per sgRNA population were\\n\\n866 screened using Western blotting and qPCR. Sanger sequencing was used to confirm\\n\\n867 full knockout status.\\n\\n868 **Cell Culture and Transfections**\\n\\n869 All cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and\\n\\n870 were maintained at 37 Â°C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator and cultured\\n\\n871 according to the ATCC recommendations. Cell line authentication was performed by\\n\\n872 STR profiling and using Cell ID[TM] system (Promega). The cultures were routinely\\n\\n873 tested for mycoplasma contamination. The information about siRNAs for _DUSP1,_\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n874 _DUSP6,_ _HER2,_ _HER3,_ _AKT1 and negative control siRNAs are in Table EV1._\\n\\n875 Transient transfections were performed with lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent\\n\\n876 (ThermoFisher) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\\n\\n877 **Cell growth assays**\\n\\n878 The cells were seeded at a density of 2 x 10[3] into 96-well plates and treated with\\n\\n879 increasing concentrations of the drugs for 48 h. Cell viability was determined using\\n\\n880 WST-1 assay (Sigma). Vehicle-treated cells were used as the control group. For the\\n\\n881 clonogenic survival assay, cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 1000\\n\\n882 cells/well. After 24 h, the media was changed, and the cells were maintained for\\n\\n883 another 10 d. The resulting colonies were stained/fixed with 0.5% crystal violet\\n\\n884 imaged using an inverted microscope.\\n\\n885 To yield DTPs in NSCLC, melanoma and colorectal cancer cell lines, the following\\n\\n886 treatments were carried out: NSCLC cell line HCC827, melanoma cell line A375, and\\n\\n887 colorectal cancer HT-29 cell line were cultured under standard conditions. The\\n\\n888 following treatments were applied for 10 d: HCC827, 1 ÂµM osimertinib; A375, 1 ÂµM\\n\\n889 dabrafenib+100 nM trametinib; HT-29, 1 ÂµM dabrafenib+10 Âµg/ml cetuximab.\\n\\n890 **Drug combination analysis**\\n\\n891 To explore the efficacy of drug combinations, growth inhibition was determined by\\n\\n892 WST-1 assay and the results were evaluated by Bliss SynergyFinder (Ianevski et al,\\n\\n893 2017). Visualization of synergy scores is depicted as a synergy map. An average\\n\\n894 synergy score of 0 is considered additive, less than 0 as antagonistic and over 0 as a\\n\\n895 synergistic outcome.\\n\\n896 **Caspase 3/7 activity assay**\\n\\n897 The Caspase-GloÂ® 3/7 Assay System (Promega), a luminescence-based assay for\\n\\n898 detection of active caspase-3 and 7, was used to quantitatively determine apoptotic\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n899 cell death. Following caspase cleavage of the proluciferin DEVD substrate, a\\n\\n900 substrate for luciferase is released and results in luciferase reaction and production\\n\\n901 of light.\\n\\n902 **Western blot analysis**\\n\\n903 The cells were lysed for 30 min in ice-cold RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150\\n\\n904 mM NaCl, 1.0% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS) containing\\n\\n905 protease and phosphatase inhibitors (ThermoFisher). The assay was performed with\\n\\n906 primary and Licor secondary antibodies (Licor Biosciences). Î²-actin was used as the\\n\\n907 loading control. The list of antibodies is in Table EV2.\\n\\n908 **Analysis of gene expression by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR**\\n\\n909 Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis was done on a\\n\\n910 QuantStudio Real-Time PCR instrument (ThermoFisher) using PowerUpâ¢ SYBRÂ®\\n\\n911 Green Master Mix (ThermoFisher). The primer sequences are listed in Table EV3.\\n\\n912 The target gene expression levels were normalized to beta-2-microglobulin (B2M)\\n\\n913 levels. For calculations, 2 [âÎÎCT] formula was used, with ÎÎCT = (CTTarget â CTB2M)\\n\\n914 experimental sample â (CTTarget â CTB2M) control samples, where CT is the cycle\\n\\n915 threshold.\\n\\n916 **Animal studies**\\n\\n917 The animal experiments were performed according to the Animal Experiment Board\\n\\n918 in Finland (ELLA) for the care and use of animals under the licenses\\n\\n919 4161/04.10.07/2015 and 9241/2018. The animals were kept under pathogen-free\\n\\n920 conditions in individually ventilated cages in an animal care facility. Mice were kept\\n\\n921 on a 12 h light/dark cycle with access to autoclaved water and irradiated chow _ad_\\n\\n922 _libitum and were allowed to adapt to the facility for 1 week before starting the_\\n\\n923 experiments. For the subcutaneous experiments, MDA-MB-453 (5 x 10[6]) and\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n924 HCC1954 (3 x 10[6]) cells were injected into the right flank of six- to eight-week-old\\n\\n925 BALB/cOlaHsd-Foxn1nu mice (Envigo, France). Mice with tumor size â¼100 mm[3]\\n\\n926 were randomized into experimental and control groups. Tumor dimensions were\\n\\n927 measured with Vernier calipers and tumor volume were calculated as 1/2 larger\\n\\n928 diameter x (smaller diameter)[2]. For the intracranial model, 1 x 10[5] cells in 5 ÂµL of\\n\\n929 PBS were inoculated into the brain of anaesthetized mice. The mice were then\\n\\n930 imaged with bioluminescence and based on the bioluminescence signal were\\n\\n931 randomized to experimental and control groups, as descried earlier (Merisaari et al,\\n\\n932 2020). Mice were euthanized when they became moribund when they reached\\n\\n933 defined study end points.\\n\\n934 **Zebrafish studies**\\n\\n935 Zebrafish embryo xenograft studies were performed under the license\\n\\n936 ESAVI/9339/04.10.07/2016 (National Animal Experimentation Board, Regional State\\n\\n937 Administrative Agency for Southern Finland). Briefly, the _DUSP6 knockdown GFP-_\\n\\n938 MDA-MB-361 cells were injected into the brain of zebrafish embryos from the dorsal\\n\\n939 side. One day after injection (1 dpi), successfully transplanted embryos were placed\\n\\n940 in CellView glass bottom 96-well plate (1 embryo/well) and embryos were incubated\\n\\n941 in E3 + PTU at 33 Â°C. The xenografted embryos were imaged using a Nikon Eclipse\\n\\n942 Ti2 fluorescence microscope and a 2x Nikon Plan-Apochromat (NA 0.06) objective.\\n\\n943 Each embryo was imaged at 1dpi and 4dpi using brightfield illumination and a GFP\\n\\n944 fluorescence filter set (excitation with 470nm LED). Each image was inspected\\n\\n945 manually to filter out severely malformed, dead or out of focus embryos. The tumor\\n\\n946 area was measured using ImageJ (NIH). The fold change in tumor size was\\n\\n947 calculated as follows: GFP intensity (4dpi)/GFP intensity (1dpi)\\n\\n948 **RNA-sequencing**\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n949 RNA-sequencing was conducted at the Finnish Functional Genomic Center, The\\n\\n950 University of Turku, Finland. RNA was harvested using the NucleoSpin RNA\\n\\n951 purification kit (MachereyâNagel), followed by treatment with DNase to remove\\n\\n952 genomic DNA. RNA (300 ng) was reverse transcribed using the Illumina TruSeq\\n\\n953 Stranded Total mRNA kit. The quality of the samples was ensured using Agilent\\n\\n954 Bioanalyzer 2100 or Advanced Analytical Fragment Analyzer. Sample concentration\\n\\n955 was measured with QubitÂ® Fluorometric Quantitation (Life Technologies) and/or\\n\\n956 KAPA Library Quantification kit for Illumina platform, KAPA Biosystems. Sequencing\\n\\n957 run was performed using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument. Genomic alignment\\n\\n958 was performed using Rsubread v. 2.0.0 and the reads were mapped to the human\\n\\n959 reference genome hg38. Aligned reads were assigned to RefSeq gene models using\\n\\n960 the same R package with its default settings.\\n\\n961 Differentially expressed genes and pathways were identified using the R package\\n\\n962 limma. Latest hallmark gene sets were downloaded from the Molecular Signatures\\n\\n963 Database version 7.4 (http://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp) and used\\n\\n964 within Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) allowing pathway enrichment estimates\\n\\n965 for each sample (Hanzelmann et al, 2013). Data was transformed using log(x+1)\\n\\n966 after normalization and the RNA-sequencing pipeline run. Heatmaps were plotted\\n\\n967 using the ComplexHeatmap package (Gu et al, 2016). R statistical software version\\n\\n968 4.0.3 was used for the statistical analyses and visualizations.\\n\\n969 **cBioPortal database analyses**\\n\\n970 The correlation analysis between gene expression and breast cancer subtypes was\\n\\n971 examined using the METABRIC breast cancer cohort with PAM50 classification\\n\\n972 (Pereira et al., 2016), TCGA breast invasive carcinoma dataset and the TCGA\\n\\n973 Firehose legacy dataset (Gao et al., 2013). The RNA-seq data from breast invasive\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n974 carcinoma samples and the relevant clinical information are available at the TCGA\\n\\n975 data portal, cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics (http://www.cbioportal.org/). According\\n\\n976 to the PAM50 classification, METABRIC breast cancer patients were divided into 5\\n\\n977 subtypes, including the basal (n=199), HER2+(n=220), Lum A (n=679), Lum B\\n\\n978 (n=461) and Normal-like (n=140). ER and HER2 status were assessed using the\\n\\n979 patientâs IHC information. The survival outcomes were extracted from the TCGA\\n\\n980 breast invasive carcinoma dataset.\\n\\n981 For multivariable Cox regression analyses, N=121 HER2+ patients from the TCGA\\n982 BRCA cohort were extracted, with reported pathological T-stages and lymph node\\n\\n983 statuses included as clinical factors and relapse free survival modelled as the end\\n984 point. Further, transcriptomics was included as log2-transformed values for RSEM\\n\\n985 normalized expression of DUSP6.\\n\\n986 **Transcription factor binding analyses**\\n\\n987 To predict transcription factors enriched in the significantly differentially regulated\\n\\n988 genes during the therapy tolerance transitions we used ChEA3: transcription factor\\n\\n989 enrichment analysis by orthogonal omics integration tool (Keenan et al, 2019).\\n\\n990 Differentially regulated genes were provided as input to the tool and the significantly\\n\\n991 associated transcription factors were obtained using ENCODE (Encyclopedia of\\n\\n992 DNA Elements) ChIP-seq library. The output file consists of a list of transcription\\n\\n993 factors arranged based on a scaled rank where a lower value means a higher\\n\\n994 significance in the gene list. An FDR value < 0.05 was considered significant.\\n\\n995 To predict the transcription factors binding the DUSP6 promotor region, Cistrome DB\\n\\n996 Toolkit was used (Zheng et al, 2019). As an input 4000 base pairs upstream of the\\n\\n997 DUSP6 gene were entered in the Cistrome DB Toolkit. This provided a list of\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n998 transcription factors based on the regulatory potential (RP score) derived by\\n\\n999 comparing the CHIP-seq data sets.\\n\\n1000 **Statistical analysis**\\n\\n1001 Differentially expressed genes and pathways were identified using the R package\\n\\n1002 limma (Ritchie et al, 2015). Latest hallmark gene sets were downloaded from the\\n\\n1003 Molecular Signatures Database version 7.4 (http://www.gsea\\n1004 msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp) and used within Gene Set Variation Analysis\\n\\n1005 (GSVA) allowing pathway enrichment estimates for each sample (Hanzelmann et al.,\\n\\n1006 2013), with FDR-cutoff <0.25 used for the pathway enrichment analyses. Data was\\n\\n1007 transformed using log(x+1) after normalization and the RNA-sequencing pipeline\\n\\n1008 run. Heatmaps were plotted using the ComplexHeatmap package (Gu et al., 2016).\\n\\n1009 R statistical software (R Core Team (2023). R: A language and environment for\\n\\n1010 statistical computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria. URL:\\n\\n1011 https://www.R-project.org) version 4.0.3 was used for the statistical analyses and\\n\\n1012 visualizations.\\n\\n1013 All data were evaluated in triplicate against the vehicle-treated control cells and\\n\\n1014 collected from three independent experiments. In addition to R analyses, data were\\n\\n1015 visualized and analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8.3.0 using one-way ANOVA and the\\n\\n1016 unpaired two-tailed studentâs t test.

Primary treatments for hydrocephalus mainly involve\\n\\nneurosurgical cerebrospinal fluid diversion, which hold high morbidity and failure rates, highlighting the\\n\\nnecessity for the discovery of novel therapeutic approaches. Although the pathophysiology of\\n\\nhydrocephalus is highly multifactorial, impaired function of the brain ependymal cells plays a\\n\\nfundamental role in hydrocephalus. Here we show that GemC1 and McIdas, key regulators of\\n\\nmulticiliated ependymal cell fate determination, induce direct cellular reprogramming towards\\n\\nependyma. Our study reveals that ectopic expression of GemC1 and McIdas reprograms cortical\\n\\nastrocytes and programs mouse embryonic stem cells into ependyma. McIdas is sufficient to establish\\n\\nfunctional activity in the reprogrammed astrocytes. Furthermore, we show that McIdasâ expression\\n\\npromotes ependymal cells regeneration in two different postnatal hydrocephalus mouse models: an\\n\\nintracranial hemorrhage and a genetic form of hydrocephalus and ameliorates the cytoarchitecture of the\\n\\nneurogenic niche. Our study provides evidence on the restoration of ependyma in animal models\\n\\nmimicking hydrocephalus that could be exploited towards future therapeutic interventions.\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\nHydrocephalus is a neurological disorder defined by the abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid\\n\\n(CSF) within the brain ventricles, leading to increased head circumference (Schrander-Stumpel & Fryns,\\n\\n1998). The condition can arise as a primary clinical feature triggered by a genetic cause (congenital\\n\\nhydrocephalus) or secondary (acquired hydrocephalus) to other insults such as central nervous system\\n\\n(CNS) infections, tumors, trauma, or hemorrhage (Rekate, 2009; Kahle et al, 2016; Kousi & Katsanis,\\n\\n2016). Malfunction of the ependymal cells is a leading cause of the pathophysiological mechanism of\\n\\nhydrocephalus as these cells have a key role in CSF circulation and composition (Ji et al, 2022). In\\n\\naddition, hydrocephalus is linked with disorganization of the subventricular neurogenic nicheâs\\n\\ncytoarchitecture and neurogenesis defects, as ependymal cells were shown to provide structural and\\n\\nfunctional support to the adult neural stem cells (Paez-Gonzalez et al, 2011; McAllister, James P. et al,\\n\\n2017; RodrÃ­guez & Guerra, 2017).\\n\\nUnder homeostatic conditions, ependymal cells form one of the largest epithelia of the brain, lying\\n\\nadjacent to the ventricular lumen and bear unique structural characteristics. The cell surface exposed to\\n\\nthe ventricular lumen contains a patch of approximately 50 modified centrioles, called basal bodies,\\n\\nwhich are tiny microtubule-based organelles responsible for nucleating an equal number of motile cilia.\\n\\nCilia are anchored Î¿n their apical surface, beating in the same direction and in a coordinated fashion,\\n\\nthus contributing to efficient CSF circulation throughout the brain (Mirzadeh et al, 2008, 2010).\\n\\nConstant ciliary beating facilitates secreted molecules dispersion to other regions of the CNS. Such\\n\\ncirculating molecules in the CSF influence neurogenesis and neuroblastsâ migration to the olfactory\\n\\nbulbs (Lim et al, 2000; Sawamoto et al, 2006).\\n\\nEpendymal cell differentiation is a multi-step process orchestrated by a tightly regulated transcriptional\\n\\nprogram which is responsible for activating numerous genes that promote amplification and docking of\\n\\ncentrioles and the formation of cilia (Kyrousi et al, 2017; Arbi et al, 2018). We have previously provided\\n\\nevidence that the Geminin family proteins, GEMC1 and MCIDAS, are the earliest regulators for the cell\\n\\nfate commitment to the ependymal lineage (Kyrousi et al, 2015). GemC1 lies upstream of McIdas\\n\\ninducing its transcriptional activation, while both upregulate genes that are essential for centriole\\n\\namplification and for promoting the downstream transcriptional machinery of multiciliogenesis (Kyrousi\\n\\net al, 2015; Arbi et al, 2016; Lalioti et al, 2019a). GEMC1 and MCIDAS cooperate with E2F4/5\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\ntranscription factors, to upregulate cMyb and Ccno, which are implicated in centriole amplification (Tan\\n\\net al, 2013; Wallmeier et al, 2014; Funk et al, 2015; Arbi et al, 2018). In addition, we and others have\\n\\nprovided evidence that GemC1 and McIdas drive the transcriptional activation of P73 and FOXJ1\\n\\ntranscription factors, which are implicated in basal bodies docking and cilia motility (Kyrousi et al,\\n\\n2015; Arbi et al, 2016; Nemajerova et al, 2016; Marshall et al, 2016; Lalioti et al, 2019a).\\n\\nGiven the multifaceted roles that ependymal cells have in hydrocephalus pathophysiology, restoration of\\n\\nependymal cells could significantly contribute to hydrocephalus therapy. With the advancements in\\n\\ndirect reprogramming-based strategies for conditions affecting the central nervous system (Bocchi et al,\\n\\n2022), it is plausible to anticipate that cellular reprogramming directed towards ependymal cells could\\n\\nrepresent a significant breakthrough in the treatment of hydrocephalus. In the present study we showed\\n\\nthat ectopic expression of GemC1 or McIdas promotes programming of mouse pluripotent embryonic\\n\\nstem cells and reprogramming of cortical astrocytes into ependymal cells, with McIdas being more\\n\\nefficient on establishing functional motile cilia in reprogrammed astrocytes. In addition, forced\\n\\nexpression of McIdas in both a genetic and an acquired hydrocephalus mouse model promoted in vivo\\n\\nreprogramming of cells residing in the ventricular walls of the diseased brain into functional ependymal\\n\\ncells. Importantly, reprogrammed ependymal cells were able to beat their cilia in a coordinated fashion\\n\\nand formed pinwheel structures together with neural stem cells in hydrocephalic mice, revealing their\\n\\npotential to regenerate the architecture of the neurogenic niche, which is disrupted in hydrocephalus.\\n\\nCollectively, our data suggest that GEMC1 and MCIDAS can orchestrate the transcriptional program of\\n\\nmulticiliogenesis establishing ependymal cell fate and differentiation, providing proof of principle\\n\\nevidence that restoration of ependymal cells could potentially contribute to hydrocephalus management.\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nGemC1 and McIdas promote programming of mouse embryonic stem cells and reprogramming of\\n\\ncortical astrocytes into ependymal cells\\n\\nGemC1 and McIdas are the most upstream regulators driving multiciliogenesis in vertebrate organisms\\n\\n(Stubbs et al, 2012; Ma et al, 2014; Boon et al, 2014; Kyrousi et al, 2015; TerrÃ© et al, 2016; Arbi et al,\\n\\n2016). We therefore postulated that GemC1 and McIdas would be capable of inducing stem cell\\n\\nprogramming towards multiciliated ependymal cells. To examine this hypothesis, mouse embryonic\\n\\nstem cells (mESCs) were transfected with plasmids encoding McIdas or GemC1 in conjunction with\\n\\nGFP (referred to as McIdas and GemC1 respectively), or GFP alone as a control. Transfected mESCs\\n\\nwere cultured for four days in the absence of Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) and subjected to\\n\\nimmunostaining for FoxJ1, a key transcription factor for the differentiation of ependymal cells, and\\n\\nPericentrin which marks nascent basal bodies (Fig EV1A). Our analysis showed that 87% of McIdas\\nand 39% of GemC1-overexpressing mESCs were expressing FoxJ1, while only 1% FoxJ1 positive cells\\n\\nwere detected in the control (Fig EV1B). In addition, we identified that 90% of McIdas- and 59% of\\n\\nGemC1-overexpressing mESCs showed accumulation of Pericentrin staining (Fig EV1C), thus\\n\\npresented multiple nascent basal bodies, corresponding to differentiating ependymal cells. Furthermore,\\n\\nwe examined whether McIdas and GemC1-overexpressing mESCs acquire multiple cilia, a unique\\n\\nstructural characteristic of the ependymal cells. Double immunofluorescence experiments were\\n\\nperformed six days following mESCs transfection using anti-Pericentrin and anti-acetylated-a-tubulin\\n\\nantibodies to mark the basal bodies and cilia, respectively (Fig EV1D). Our analysis revealed that 66%\\n\\nof McIdas- and 21% of GemC1- overexpressing mESCs develop multiple cilia arising from numerous\\n\\nbasal bodies. On the contrary, control mESCs develop neither multiple basal bodies nor cilia (Fig\\n\\nEV1D, E). Our data show that ectopic expression of McIdas and GemC1 programs mESCs into\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nmulticiliated ependymal cells.\\n\\nNext, we sought out to explore the reprogramming potential of McIdas and GemC1 in astrocytes that\\n\\nunder physiological conditions do not differentiate into ependymal cells. Astrocytes were isolated from\\n\\nthe cortex of neonatal mice and were subsequently infected with lentiviruses expressing GFP-McIdas or\\n\\nGFP-GemC1 (referred to as McIdas and GemC1, respectively), while lentiviruses expressing GFP alone\\n\\nwere used as control. Cells were subsequently cultured under differentiating conditions and\\n\\nimmunofluorescence experiments were conducted to assess the expression of known ependymal and\\n\\nastrocytic markers (Fig. 1A). Ectopic expression of both McIdas and GemC1 resulted in P73 expression,\\n\\na marker of the early steps of ependymogenesis, in 37% and 36% of McIdas- and GemC1- infected\\n\\ncells, respectively, while in the control condition only 4% of the transduced cells was expressing P73\\n\\n(Fig. 1B, C, and EV 2A, B). Notably, concurrent changes in the expression pattern of the astrocytic\\n\\nmarker S100Î² were observed in approximately 20% of McIdas- and 18% of GemC1- infected\\n\\nastrocytes, as S100Î² expression was detected around their cell body, which is characteristic for\\n\\nependymal cells (Mirzadeh et al, 2008) (Fig. 1B-D and EV. 2A-C). On the contrary, control astrocytes\\n\\nretained a cytoplasmic expression of the S100Î² protein, a typical feature of astrocytes. Overall, our data\\n\\nsuggest that ectopic expression of McIdas and GemC1 can lead to the acquisition of the ependymal cell\\n\\nfate.\\n\\nSubsequently, we examined whether McIdas- and GemC1-transduced astrocytes successfully\\n\\ndifferentiate into ependymal cells. We performed immunofluorescence experiments using specific\\n\\nantibodies recognizing FoxJ1 and Pericentrin, to identify astrocytes that acquired the ependymal fate and\\n\\nsuccessfully managed to multiply their basal bodies, respectively. Our analysis showed that fourteen\\n\\ndays post infection 49% of McIdas- and 19% of GemC1- infected astrocytes were expressing FoxJ1\\n\\n(Fig. 1E, F and EV2D, E). In addition, 28% of the McIdas- and 12% of GemC1- infected astrocytes\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\npossessed multiple basal bodies, indicated by the accumulation of Pericentrin signal (Fig. 1G and\\n\\nEV2F). Moreover, expression of a GFP lentivirus did not result into FoxJ1 expression nor accumulation\\n\\nof Pericentrin.\\n\\nIn addition, we examined the ability of McIdas and GemC1 to repress the astrocytic identity of the\\n\\ntransduced astrocytes. Towards this direction, the combined expression of the astrocytic markers GFAP\\n\\nand S100Î² was assessed through immunofluorescence experiments at fourteen days post infection. Our\\n\\nanalysis revealed that McIdas ectopic expression resulted to 23% of GFAP+/S100Î²+ double positive\\n\\ncells compared to 31% in the control condition (Appendix Fig. S1A, B). We did not observe statistically\\n\\nsignificant change in the percentage of GFAP+/S100Î²+ double positive cells following GemC1 ectopic\\n\\nexpression (Appendix Fig. S1C). In addition, we examined the percentage of infected cells that were\\n\\nGFAP- and reveal S100Î² expression around the cell body, which correspond to ependymal cells. We\\n\\nshowed that 28% McIdas- and 22% GemC1- infected astrocytes present this expression pattern\\n\\n(Appendix Fig. S1A, B), which is in accordance with our analysis performed in earlier stages of\\n\\nreprogramming (Fig. 1D). Our results indicate that a significant percentage of the infected astrocytes are\\n\\nreprogrammed to the ependymal lineage and possess unique ependymal morphological characteristics.\\n\\nMoreover, we showed that McIdas is more potent in the downregulation of the astrocytic identity of the\\n\\ntransduced cells.\\n\\nGemC1 is positioned upstream of McIdas in the molecular pathway governing ependymogenesis, as it\\n\\nregulates the transcriptional activation of McIdas and controls the initial fate commitment towards the\\n\\nependymal lineage (Kyrousi et al, 2015, 2017). Our results suggest that GemC1 was less effective than\\n\\nMcIdas in reprogramming of astrocytes. We have therefore examined whether ectopic expression of\\n\\nGemC1 in astrocytes would not induce McIdas expression at sufficient levels. To test this hypothesis, we\\n\\nconducted immunofluorescence experiments using an McIdas specific antibody and quantified McIdas\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nfluorescence in McIdas- and GemC1-infected astrocytes seven days post infection (Appendix Fig. S2A).\\n\\nOur results revealed that McIdasâ ectopic expression led to higher expression levels compared to GemC1\\n\\n(Appendix Fig. S2B), providing a potential mechanism for their differential ability to induce\\n\\nreprogramming.\\n\\nGiven the greater capacity of McIdas to induce the ependymal differentiation in astrocytes compared to\\n\\nGemC1, we hypothesized that McIdas would reprogram cortical astrocytes into fully mature ependymal\\n\\ncells carrying multiple basal bodies nucleating motile cilia. To address this point, we initially performed\\n\\nimmunofluorescence experiments in transduced astrocytes twenty-two days post infection using\\n\\nantibodies against Centriolin (also known as Cep110), a known centrosomal marker, and Meig1 which\\n\\nwas recently characterized as ependymal cell marker (MacDonald et al, 2021). We detected\\n\\naccumulation of both Centriolin (Appendix Fig.S3A) and Meig1 (Appendix Fig.S3B) signal in McIdas\\ninfected astrocytes, verifying the generation of multiple basal bodies upon McIdasâ ectopic expression.\\n\\nNext, we performed immunofluorescence experiments making use of antibodies against acetylated a\\ntubulin, which stains ciliary axonemes, and the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP).\\n\\nThe ectopic expression of McIdas resulted in the downregulation of GFAP expression and the generation\\n\\nof multiple cilia on the surface of the reprogrammed astrocytes, revealing the loss of the astrocytic\\n\\nidentity and the establishment of the ependymal differentiation (Fig. 2A). Our analysis showed that 18%\\n\\nof McIdas- infected astrocytes were reprogrammed into multiciliated ependymal cells based on\\n\\nacetylated-a-tubulin staining (Fig. 2C), which was consistent with the percentage of McIdas- infected\\n\\ncells that downregulate the expression of the astrocytic marker GFAP (Fig. 2B). Additionally, live\\n\\nimaging microscopy experiments were performed in transduced astrocytes twenty-two days post\\n\\ninfection to address the ability of the reprogrammed astrocytes multicilia to beat (Movies EV1-4). Using\\n\\nhigh-speed video microscopy, we acquired fast video recordings from GFP (Movies EV1-2) and\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nMcIdas- infected astrocytes (Movies EV3-4), which revealed the presence of ciliary motility in McIdas\\ninfected cells as opposed to the absence of motility in GFP- infected cells. Importantly, our analysis\\n\\nshowed that McIdas expression established cilia movement that was sufficient to propel fluorescent\\n\\nparticles added to the imaging medium, highlighting the functionality of the ependymal cells and their\\n\\ncapability to create a fluid flow. On the contrary, astrocytes infected with a control virus were unable to\\n\\npropel the fluorescent particles, as were only observed to have a rather stable forward and backward\\n\\nmotion (Fig. 2D).\\n\\nOur findings show that GemC1 and McIdas promote the early steps of the multiciliogenesis program in\\n\\nboth embryonic stem cells and astrocytes. Importantly, McIdas has a greater capacity for eliciting direct\\n\\nreprogramming into functional ependymal cells.\\n\\nMcIdas induces ependymal cells regeneration in a mouse model of intracranial hemorrhage\\n\\nhydrocephalus\\n\\nIn both human and murine hydrocephalus, the disrupted ependymal cell population is replaced by\\n\\nastrocytes. However, this astrocytic scarring along the denuded ventricular wall fails to restore the\\n\\nependymal functions (Sival et al, 2011; Roales-BujÃ¡n et al, 2012; Guerra et al, 2015; McAllister, James\\n\\nP. et al, 2017). Based on our finding that McIdas can successfully reprogram cortical astrocytes into\\n\\nfunctional ependymal cells, we examined whether McIdas could induce direct reprogramming of\\n\\nperiventricular cells in hydrocephalic models. We used an established mouse model of intracranial\\n\\nhemorrhage hydrocephalus induced by the elevated concentration of Lysophosphatidic Acid (LPA) in\\n\\nthe brain (Yung et al, 2015; Lummis et al, 2019), which closely mirrors the most common type of\\n\\nhuman hydrocephalus.\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nBased on previously established protocols (Yung et al, 2011; Lummis et al, 2019), postnatal day five\\n\\n(P5) mice received intracranial injections of LPA and mouse brains were examined two days later to\\n\\nevaluate hydrocephalus occurrence. Although no obvious differences were observed in the size of LPA\\ntreated brains macroscopically (Fig. EV3A), coronal brain sections revealed ventricular dilation in LPA\\ninjected animals compared to non-injected ones (Fig. EV3B), confirming the development of\\n\\nhydrocephalus. In addition, acetylated-a-tubulin immunofluorescence revealed the ciliary disruption in\\n\\nependymal cells alongside the ventricular walls upon LPA administration (Fig. EV3C), in line with\\n\\nprevious studies (Lummis et al, 2019). On the contrary, ependymal cells with multiple cilia covered the\\n\\nentire ventricular walls in control animals (Fig. EV3C). Given that the ventricular walls of the LPA\\ninjected hydrocephalic mice were denuded from ependymal cells we wished to determine their cellular\\n\\ncomposition. We performed immunofluorescence with an antibody against the astrocytic marker glial\\n\\nfibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Our analysis showed that GFAP positive cells with long processes,\\n\\nwhich likely corresponded to reactive astrocytes, covered the walls of the lateral ventricles in regions\\n\\nwhere ependymal cells localize under physiological conditions (Fig. EV3C), in line with previous\\n\\nfindings (Roales-BujÃ¡n et al, 2012).\\n\\nTo assess whether McIdas can induce direct reprogramming into ependyma in LPA-induced\\n\\nhydrocephalus, GFP-McIdas (McIdas) or GFP expressing plasmids were electroporated onto P7 brains\\n\\nisolated from LPA-treated mice by targeting the dorsolateral wall of one lateral ventricle to introduce\\n\\nplasmids in cells located at periventricular regions. Subsequently, thick coronal brain sections at the\\n\\nlevel of the lateral ventricles were cultured and immunofluorescence was performed using established\\n\\nependymal markers (Fig. 3A). Five days post electroporation, 77% of the McIdas-electroporated cells\\n\\nexpressed P73, as opposed to 13% of the GFP-electroporated cells, suggesting that astrocytes that\\n\\nreplaced damaged ependymal cells in LPA treated hydrocephalic mouse models acquired the ependymal\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nfate (Fig. 3B).\\n\\nAs ependymal cells normally require approximately two weeks until they acquire their mature\\n\\ncharacteristics in vivo, we followed differentiation of electroporated cells at later time points and\\n\\nexamined whether they differentiate into fully mature multiciliated cells. Towards this direction, we\\n\\nperformed immunolabeling experiments making use of antibodies recognizing Pericentrin to mark basal\\n\\nbodies and acetylated-a-tubulin to detect cilia (Fig. 3C). Nine days post electroporation 67% of McIdas\\n\\nelectroporated cells carried multiple basal bodies (Fig. 3D), while 16% of McIdas-electroporated cells\\n\\ncarried multiple cilia as revealed by acetylated-a-tubulin immunostaining (Fig. 3E). Basal bodies\\n\\namplification or multiple cilia formation was not detected in any of the control cells, electroporated with\\n\\na GFP expressing plasmid.\\n\\nCollectively, our data show that McIdas forced expression in brain periventricular cells has the potential\\n\\nto regenerate the ependymal cells in a mouse model of intracranial hemorrhage hydrocephalus.\\n\\nMcIdas promotes in vivo reprogramming towards functional ependymal cells in a model of\\n\\ncongenital hydrocephalus\\n\\nWe have recently described that genetic mutations in the human and mouse GemC1 gene lead to\\n\\nhydrocephalus (Lalioti et al, 2019b). Moreover, we have shown that radial glial cells lacking functional\\n\\nGemC1 fail to commit to the ependymal lineage and therefore do not develop ependymal cells during\\n\\nembryogenesis. We took advantage of the GemC1-knockout genetic mouse model of hydrocephalus we\\n\\nhave generated to investigate whether reprogramming towards the ependymal cells could be achieved in\\n\\na model of congenital hydrocephalus.\\n\\nWe initially examined whether McIdas could program radial glial cells derived from GemC1-knockout\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nhydrocephalic mice into ependymal cells ex vivo. Postnatal radial glial cells isolated from GemC1\\nknockout mice were infected with lentiviruses expressing either a GFP-McIdas (McIdas) fusion protein\\n\\nor GFP as a control. Infected cells were analyzed at different time points for the expression of known\\n\\nependymal markers by immunofluorescence experiments, using specific antibodies recognizing FOXJ1,\\n\\nPericentrin and acetylated-a-tubulin proteins (Fig. EV4A). At five days post infection, 86% of the\\n\\nMcIdas-infected cells expressed FoxJ1 and showed accumulation of multiple basal bodies, based on\\n\\nPericentrin immunostaining (Fig. EV4B, C). Moreover, our analysis revealed that 97% of the McIdas\\n\\ntransduced cells were multiciliated 15 days following infection, based on acetylated-a-tubulin and\\n\\nPericentrin staining (Fig. EV3D, E). By contrast, in GFP transduced cells neither FoxJ1 expression nor\\n\\nmultiple basal bodies and cilia were observed. In addition, similar experiments were performed by\\n\\nectopically expressing P73 in postnatal radial glial cells isolated from GemC1-knockout mice. Ectopic\\n\\nexpression of P73 was not sufficient to induce FoxJ1 expression nor multiple basal bodies or multiple\\n\\ncilia formation in GemC1-knockout radial glial cells (Fig. EV4A-E). These results show that cells\\n\\nderived from a genetic model of hydrocephalus can be programmed ex vivo into multiciliated ependymal\\n\\ncells.\\n\\nIn order to examine whether McIdas promotes cellular reprogramming towards the ependymal cell\\n\\nlineage in vivo, we have used our genetic mouse model of hydrocephalus which was previously\\n\\nestablished (Lalioti et al, 2019b). Plasmid vectors encoding McIdas in conjunction with GFP or GFP\\n\\nalone were electroporated into one lateral ventricle of newborn GemC1-knockout mouse brains targeting\\n\\nperiventricular cells which could be either neural progenitor cells or reactive astrocytes that have\\n\\nreplaced the lost ependymal cell population (Roales-BujÃ¡n et al, 2012; Gonzalez-Cano et al, 2016; Abdi\\n\\net al, 2018; Lalioti et al, 2019b). Reprogramming towards the ependymal cells was evaluated through\\n\\nimmunofluorescence, using molecular markers that determine different stages of ependymogenesis.\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nInterestingly, four days post electroporation 61% and 58% of McIdas-electroporated cells were\\n\\nimmunopositive for the ependymal markers P73 (Fig. 4A, B) and FoxJ1, respectively (Fig. EV5A, B).\\n\\nThe expression of P73 and FoxJ1 was not detected in control animals, in agreement to what was\\n\\npreviously described (Lalioti et al, 2019b), as GemC1-knockout mice lack ependymal cells. We also\\n\\nshowed that McIdas further promoted the differentiation of the electroporated ependymal cells as basal\\n\\nbodies amplification was observed, based on Pericentrin immunofluorescence (Fig. 4C). More\\n\\nspecifically, upon McIdas overexpression 44% of the electroporated cells acquired multiple basal bodies\\n\\n(Fig. 4D). In addition, immunofluorescence against acetylated-a-tubulin revealed that McIdas\\n\\noverexpression resulted in the formation of cilia in a significant number of cells, corresponding to 7% of\\n\\nMcIdas electroporated cells (Fig. 4E). Noticeably, ciliated cells were located close to the ventricles,\\n\\nresembling normal mature multiciliated ependymal cells, which form a single-layered ciliated\\n\\nepithelium adjacent to the brain ventricle.\\n\\nIn order to examine whether the cilia that were generated upon McIdas ectopic expression were motile,\\n\\nthick coronal brain sections from GemC1-knockout mice covering the lateral brain ventricles were\\n\\nobtained and used in live imaging microscopy experiments (Fig. 5A). Electroporated cells were\\n\\nidentified under a FITC filter and their cilia beating capacity was examined in fast video records. A\\n\\nproportion of cells with multiple beating cilia that were GFP-negative in sections derived from McIdas\\nelectroporated brains were observed. We have previously shown that GemC1-knockout mice are unable\\n\\nto generate ependymal cells (Lalioti et al, 2019b), therefore cells carrying multiple beating cilia that do\\n\\nnot appear GFP-positive were possibly observed due to the loss of the transgene because of its transient\\n\\nexpression and were thus undetectable under the FITC filter. In addition to this, we cannot exclude the\\n\\npossibility of dilution of the GFP signal due to continued proliferation. In agreement with what was\\n\\npreviously described cilia were not detected in brain sections following GFP overexpression. However,\\n\\n13\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nMcIdas electroporated cells exhibited functional beating cilia (Fig. 5B and Movies EV5, 6).\\n\\nKymographs were generated (Fig. 5C) following previously described methods by Francis et al. (Francis\\n\\n& Lo, 2013) and ciliary beating frequency of McIdas induced ependymal cells was estimated to have a\\n\\nmean value of 10 Hz (Fig. 5D).\\n\\nOur findings show that McIdas induces ependymal cells restoration in the diseased hydrocephalic brain.\\n\\nMcIdas expression contributes to the restoration of the subventricular zone niche cytoarchitecture\\n\\nin hydrocephalic mice.\\n\\nThe adult subventricular zone niche has a well-defined architecture formed by pinwheel-like structures.\\n\\nThese structures are assembled by the large apical domain of ependymal cells which surround the\\n\\nsmaller apical domain of adult neural stem cells (aNSCs) and constitute a unique micro-environment for\\n\\ncoordinating adult neurogenesis (Mirzadeh et al, 2008; Paez-Gonzalez et al, 2011; Kokovay et al, 2012).\\n\\nTo assess whether McIdas is able to restore the subventricular zone nicheâs cytoarchitecture in\\n\\nhydrocephalic mice, whole-mount immunofluorescence was performed on ventricular walls of the\\n\\nlateral ventricles of GemC1-knockout hydrocephalic mice at P7-P9, previously electroporated with an\\n\\nMcIdas-expressing plasmid or GFP alone. Specific antibodies against VCAM1 and GFAP, both markers\\n\\nof aNSCs, and Î²-catenin to delineate cell boundaries were used. Our analysis showed that McIdas\\nelectroporated cells had a larger apical surface compared to control GFP-electroporated cells, which is\\n\\ncharacteristic for multiciliated ependymal cells. In addition, McIdas-electroporated cells were\\n\\nsurrounding VCAM1- (Fig. 6A) and GFAP-immunopositive cells (Fig. 6B) reminiscent of pinwheel\\n\\nstructures. On the contrary, control GFP-electroporated cells had a small apical surface and pinwheel\\n\\nstructures were not detectable as it was previously described (Lalioti et al, 2019b). We also quantified\\n\\nthe number of electroporated cells that were detected in pinwheel structures, revealing that 18% of\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nMcIdas-expressing cells were able to form pinwheel structures as opposed to GFP-electroporated cells\\n\\nthat were not detected in pinwheels (Fig. 6C). Our data suggest that McIdas expression is sufficient to\\n\\ninstruct the regeneration of ependymal cells in hydrocephalic mice which have the potential to re-build\\n\\nthe lost architecture of the subventricular zone niche.\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\n\\nDuring mammalian brain development neural progenitor cells transition from an uncommitted to a\\n\\nrestricted state, through a process that is influenced by lineage-specific gene expression programs,\\n\\nresulting to terminally differentiated cells. Reprogramming allows the conversion of differentiated cells\\n\\nfrom one lineage to another type of differentiated cell. Efficient reprogramming is highly dependent on\\n\\nthe selection of pioneer factors related to the desired cell type. Here, we demonstrate that GEMC1 and\\n\\nMCIDAS, members of the geminin family, constitute potent reprogramming factors towards the\\n\\nependymal fate both ex vivo and in vivo.\\n\\nGemC1 and McIdas drive the cell fate commitment of a subpopulation of brain radial glial cells towards\\n\\nmulticiliated ependymal cells by coordinating gene expression of essential factors for ependymal cell\\n\\ndifferentiation (Kyrousi et al, 2015). In addition, we have recently provided evidence that GemC1\\n\\nexpression is necessary and sufficient to establish the appropriate chromatin organization at multiple loci\\n\\nfor ependymal cells differentiation (Lalioti et al, 2019b). In light of this evidence, we hypothesized that\\n\\nGemC1 and McIdas could promote direct reprogramming towards the ependymal lineage in different\\n\\ncellular populations under physiology and disease. We initially demonstrated that both GemC1 and\\n\\nMcIdas overexpression were able to trigger the differentiation of mESCs into ependymal cells, as\\n\\nevidenced by the upregulation of key factors of ependymogenesis and the generation of multiple cilia in\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nthe GemC1- and McIdas overexpressing cells. We also showed that GemC1 and McIdas overexpression\\n\\ninduce the expression of P73 and FoxJ1, two well-established transcription factors of the molecular\\n\\npathway of multiciliogenesis, in cultured cortical astrocytes. Importantly, we demonstrated that GemC1\\n\\nand McIdas activate the ependymal fate and induce the formation of multiple basal bodies and cilia in\\n\\nthe reprogrammed cells. The ectopic expression of GemC1 resulted in a lower percentage of cells with\\n\\nmultiple basal bodies, a unique structural feature of ependymal cells, revealing a differential\\n\\nreprogramming potential of the two factors. We showed that GemC1 does not induce sufficient levels of\\n\\nMcIdas expression, that could contribute to the reduced ability of GemC1 to execute as efficiently the\\n\\nependymal differentiation program. Moreover, using video microscopy experiments we showed that\\n\\nMcIdas ectopic expression was sufficient to reprogram cortical astrocytes into fully functional\\n\\nmulticiliated ependymal cells, as reprogrammed cells possessed multiple beating cilia that were able to\\n\\nbeat in a co-ordinated way and generate fluid flow. In addition, McIdas overexpression was sufficient to\\n\\ninduce the ependymal fate in radial glial cells derived from the brain of hydrocephalic mice in great\\n\\ncontrast to P73, further highlighting McIdasâ ability to induce the ependymal cell fate. The stem cell\\n\\nproperties of the mESCs and radial glial cells used in our study are likely to facilitate the adoption of the\\n\\nependymal fate. Since this aligns with their differentiation spectrum their conversion to ependyma could\\n\\nbe considered as differentiation into the ependymal cell lineage.\\n\\nIt has been shown that in human and experimental hydrocephalus, disrupted ependyma is replaced by\\n\\nastroglial cells (Sival et al, 2011; Roales-BujÃ¡n et al, 2012; Guerra et al, 2015; McAllister, James P. et al\\n\\n, 2017). This astrocytic scarring along the denuded ventricular wall contributes to the pathophysiology\\n\\nof the disease as astrocytes do not restore ependymal functions; as they do not display cilia, produce\\n\\nappropriate trophic signals, or facilitate the production of neurons (Sival et al, 2011; Roales-BujÃ¡n et al,\\n\\n2012). Therefore, our strategy revealing the successful conversion of isolated cortical astrocytes into\\n\\n16\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nependymal cells is of particular importance for treatment of hydrocephalus.\\n\\nTo investigate whether McIdas would also reprogram cells in vivo, we used a mouse model of congenital\\n\\nhydrocephalus in which GemC1 has been inactivated, and a model of acquired hydrocephalus, triggered\\n\\nby intracranial hemorrhage. It was previously shown that GemC1 deficiency in mice results in the loss\\n\\nof the ependymal cells due to failure on activating the molecular program for the cell fate commitment\\n\\ntowards the ependymal lineage (TerrÃ© et al, 2016; Lalioti et al, 2019b). Moreover, GemC1 deficiency\\n\\nhas been recently associated with congenital hydrocephalus in both humans and mice (Lalioti et al,\\n\\n2019b). In this study, we showed that McIdas forced expression induces the upregulation of P73 and\\n\\nFoxJ1 in brain periventricular cells, which are likely to be neural progenitor cells or/and reactive\\n\\nastrocytes that have replaced the ependymal cell population in the hydrocephalic brain. The activation of\\n\\nthe P73 and FoxJ1 genes uncovered the ability of McIdas to promote the initial steps of the ependymal\\n\\ncellâs differentiation program in the hydrocephalic brain. We also showed that McIdas-overexpressing\\n\\ncells generated multiple basal bodies and cilia, both of which are unique features of mature multiciliated\\n\\nependymal cells, thus revealing the successful reprogramming towards ependyma. Importantly, the\\n\\nmultiple cilia of the reprogrammed cells presented functional activity, as we were able to detect beating\\n\\ncilia upon in vivo overexpression of McIdas in the hydrocephalic mice. Using the LPA-induced\\n\\nintracranial hydrocephalus mouse model, we demonstrated McIdas ability to convert periventricular\\n\\ncells into ependymal cells. Previous study has shown that LPA causes substantial depletion of the\\n\\nependymal monolayer, loss of ependymal cilia and subsequent ependymal apoptotic cell death (Lummis\\n\\net al, 2019). In line with these findings, we did not observe multiciliated ependymal cells in\\n\\nperiventricular regions after LPA treatment. Instead, we observed GFAP-positive cells, likely reactive\\n\\nastrocytes, covering the lateral ventricle walls where ependymal cells typically reside under normal\\n\\nconditions, as it has been previously shown in hydrocephalic mice (PÃ¡ez et al, 2007; Roales-BujÃ¡n et al,\\n\\n17\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n2012). Therefore, it is highly likely that McIdas reprograms astrocytes into ependymal cells in LPA\\ntreated mice. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that McIdas might also enhance the survival of\\n\\na subset of ependymal cells resistant to LPA-induced apoptosis.\\u200b\\n\\nCollectively, in our experiments we employed diverse cellular systems and technical approaches,\\n\\nincluding plasmid and lentiviral vectors, to induce the overexpression of McIdas and GemC1 suggesting\\n\\nthat both GemC1 and McIdas can induce the programming or reprogramming of different cellular\\n\\npopulations irrespectively of the cell system and vector used. While our approach in the genetic mouse\\n\\nmodel of hydrocephalus and the LPA-induced intracranial hydrocephalus likely targets periventricular\\n\\ncells, which are neural progenitor cells or/and reactive astrocytes, we cannot rule out the possibility that\\n\\nother cellular populations might also be targeted. Recent evidence from reprogramming experiments in\\n\\nthe mouse retina and the brain indicates that the insert sequences of overexpression constructs can alter\\n\\nthe specificity of the construct's promoter, introducing a bias toward the initial cell population being\\n\\ntargeted (Wang et al, 2021; Le et al, 2022). Additionally, future genetic lineage analysis using transgenic\\n\\nmice to label neural progenitors and/or astrocytes would be needed to clarify which cell population is\\n\\ndifferentiated into ependymal cells in our approach. One of the major clinical features in human patients\\n\\nwith hydrocephalus is the ventricular zone disruption phenomenon, characterized by the loss of neural\\n\\nstem cells and ependyma (McAllister, James P. et al, 2017). Of note, sustained neuron generation\\n\\ndepends on the maintenance of the proper cytoarchitecture of the Ventricular-Subventricular Zone (V\\nSVZ) niche of the brain, which requires preserving the structure of the ependymal cell monolayer intact\\n\\n(Paez-Gonzalez et al, 2011). In the present study, we targeted V-SVZ-resident cells in the hydrocephalic\\n\\nbrain in which McIdas overexpression was induced and observed that McIdas-overexpressing cells\\n\\npopulated areas of the ventricular zone niche next to the lateral ventricles, where ependymal cells\\n\\nnormally reside under homeostasis. We have used SVZ electroporation to target the periventricular cells\\n\\n18\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nof one lateral ventricle of the hydrocephalic brain of GemC1-knockout mice, which results to a limited\\n\\nnumber of electroporated cells. Therefore, following this experimental approach, the small number of\\n\\nependymal cells which is generated is not possible to contribute to a significant reduction in the volume\\n\\nof the lateral ventricles as a readout of resolved or reduced hydrocephalus. It has been described that\\n\\ndisruption of the ventricular/subventricular zone (V/SVZ) is a critical and consistent factor in the\\n\\npathophysiology of hydrocephalus (McAllister, James P. et al, 2017; JimÃ©nez et al, 2014). In our study\\n\\nwe showed that McIdas ectopic expression contributes to the restoration of the lost cytoarchitecture of\\n\\nthe niche in hydrocephalic mice, as we identified reprogrammed ependymal cells forming pinwheel-like\\n\\nstructures with resident neural stem cells in the targeted ventricular wall. Our findings suggest that\\n\\nMcIdas forced expression in human patients with hydrocephalus would contribute to the re\\nestablishment of the SVZ niche leading to brain functionsâ improvement by enhancing neuronal\\n\\nproduction in human patients with hydrocephalus and ameliorating brain function. The in vivo\\n\\nreprogramming approach indicates that the in-situ conversion of cells into ependyma in its native\\n\\nmicroenvironment is feasible. Our in vivo approach allowed the exploration of the influence of the\\n\\ndiseased environment of the hydrocephalic brain on the reprogramming process. Our data support the\\n\\nidea that functional maturation and integration of the reprogrammed cells in the native tissue can be\\n\\nachieved through our in vivo reprogramming method. Since the molecular program of multiciliogenesis\\n\\nis conserved across different organisms and tissues (Arbi et al, 2018), it is tempting to speculate that\\n\\nsuch a reprogramming approach could be applied to other diseases that impact ciliated tissues, such as\\n\\nthe lung and the reproductive system. For instance, a rare genetic disorder affecting the mucociliary\\n\\nclearance mechanism, known as Reduced Generation of Multiple Motile Cilia (RGMC), has been linked\\n\\nto mutations in MCIDAS. Therefore, it would be highly interesting to investigate whether these\\n\\nconditions could be addressed in the future through a genetic treatment implementing McIdasâ\\n\\n19\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\noverexpression in the affected tissue.\\n\\nTogether, our analysis proposes MCIDAS and GEMC1 as potent reprogramming factors towards the\\n\\nependymal cell lineage and demonstrate a proof of concept that restoring ependymal cells could\\n\\ncontribute in managing hydrocephalus. Although the present study yielded intriguing findings, our\\n\\nimplementation holds certain limitations. In particular, our in vivo studies have been conducted to mouse\\n\\nmodels of hydrocephalus. Despite sharing a similar pathophysiology with the human disease, the\\n\\nanatomical and physiological characteristics of the mouse and human brain possess certain differences.\\n\\nTherefore, to validate the effectiveness of our approach, additional experiments in disease models closer\\n\\nto human pathophysiology will be required. The pig model demonstrates anatomical and physiological\\n\\nsimilarities to humans and replicates the pathophysiology of human hydrocephalus, exhibiting features\\n\\nsuch as ventriculomegaly, V/SVZ disruption, and neuroinflammation and could thus be a valuable model\\n\\nfor examining the translational success of our approach to the human conditions (Garcia-Bonilla et al,\\n\\n2023). Additionally, since hydrocephalus in our study appeared during early developmental stages, our\\n\\nfindings are particularly relevant to postnatal hydrocephalus. Therefore, their applicability to adult\\n\\nhydrocephalus will require further investigation using appropriate adult animal models. Although we\\n\\nachieved McIdas overexpression in the periventricular cells of the diseased brain through\\n\\nelectroporation, such an approach cannot be used in humans. Therefore, alternative gene delivery\\n\\nmethods compatible with therapeutic protocols, such as AAV gene delivery strategies in the human brain\\n\\n(Chamakioti et al, 2022; Au et al, 2022) should be established. Our study shows that regeneration of\\n\\nmulticiliated ependymal cells can be succeeded in hydrocephalic mouse models while further\\n\\nexperiments are needed to show the applicability of our findings in treating hydrocephalus in humans.\\n\\n20\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nMETHODS\\n\\nMouse knockout strain\\n\\nC57/Bl6 mice carrying a knockout (KO) allele of the GemC1 gene were initially generated by the trans\\nNIH Knock-Out Mouse Project (KOMP) and obtained from the KOMP repository. The GemC1-KO\\n\\nallele was maintained on a mixed strain background. Inactivation of the GemC1 gene was carried out\\n\\nusing the âknockout-firstâ strategy, as previously described (Arbi et al, 2016; Lalioti et al, 2019b). This\\n\\napproach involves disrupting gene function by adding RNA processing signals without removing any of\\n\\nthe targeted genes (Testa et al, 2004). The GemC1-KO allele was created by placing a lacZ-neo cassette\\n\\nbetween the second and third exon of the gene.\\n\\nMice were housed in the animal house of the University of Patras, where a standard light cycle of 12\\n\\nhours of light and 12 hours of darkness was maintained. Continuous access to food and water was\\n\\nensured at all times. To ensure animal welfare handling and environmental stressors like noise,\\n\\nvibrations, and strong odors were minimized to necessary levels. All animal-related procedures were\\n\\nconducted in strict accordance with EU directives and approved by the Veterinary Administrations of the\\n\\nPrefecture of Achaia, Greece, and the Research Ethics Committee of the University of Patras, Greece.\\n\\nIn all experiments, mice were used without regard to their gender. Experiments involving animal usage\\n\\nwere conducted during the neonatal stage when the gender of the animals was not yet distinguishable.\\n\\nLPA preparation and injections\\n\\nTo generate an inducible mouse model of intracranial-hemorrhage hydrocephalus, we performed\\n\\nintraventricular delivery of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in wild-type (WT) mice at postnatal day five\\n\\n(P5), following previously published works (Yung et al, 2011; Lummis et al, 2019).\\n\\nPowdered 18:1 LPA (857130P, Avanti Polar Lipids) was initially dissolved in methanol and subsequently\\n\\nvacuum-dried. LPA was then reconstituted in Hanksâ balanced salt solution (HBSS 14065-049, Gibco)\\n\\nby sonicating in a water bath for 5 min to generate a 10 mM stock, as previously described (Yung et al,\\n\\n2011; Lummis et al, 2019). Stock solution was stored at â20Â°C until use. Using a glass microcapillary, 3\\n\\nÎ¼l of the 10 mM LPA stock solution together with Fast Green (0.1%, Sigma) were injected into the\\n\\nlateral ventricle of P5 mice upon hypothermia-anesthetization. Mice were sacrificed two days post LPA\\n\\ninjections at P7 and were examined or further processed as described in the respective experiments.\\n\\n21\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nPlasmid constructs\\n\\nFor neonatal electroporation and mESCs transfection experiments mouse cDNAs for McIdas and\\n\\nGemC1 were cloned in pCAGGS-IRES-GFP vectors between SacI/EcoRV and NheI/SmaI restriction\\n\\nsites respectively, as described previously (Kyrousi et al, 2015).\\n\\nNeonatal electroporation\\n\\nNeonatal electroporation was performed at P0-P1. Anesthesia was induced via hypothermia. Using a\\n\\npulled glass microcapillary, 2 Î¼g plasmid DNA together with Fast Green (0.1%, Sigma) were injected in\\n\\nthe lateral ventricle of the mouse brains. Mice were subsequently electroporated with 5 pulses of 100V\\n\\nfor 50ms each followed by intervals of 950ms. An ECM830 Electroporator (Harvard Apparatus) and 7\\n\\nmm platinum electrodes (BTX) were used. Following electroporation mice were placed back to cages\\n\\nand left to grow for 4 or 6-14 days before sacrificed as described in the respective experiments.\\n\\nEx vivo electroporation and organotypic brain slice cultures\\n\\nFor ex vivo electroporation, mice were sacrificed 2 days post LPA-injections at P7. Mouse brains were\\n\\ndissected and placed in cold DMEM/F-12 medium (Gibco). Subsequently, 2 Î¼g plasmid DNA of a\\n\\npCAGGS-IRES-GFP (GFP) or pCAGGS-McIdas-IRES-GFP (McIdas) vector together with Fast Green\\n\\n(0.1%, Sigma) were injected in the lateral ventricle using a pulled glass microcapillary. Brains were then\\n\\nelectroporated with 5 pulses applied at 100V for 50ms each at intervals of 950ms. An ECM830\\n\\nElectroporator (Harvard Apparatus) and 7 mm platinum electrodes (BTX) were used.\\n\\nFor organotypic brain slice cultures 250 Î¼m thick coronal slices were obtained from the electroporated\\n\\nbrains using a vibrating microtome (Leica VT1000 S). Consecutive slices containing the lateral\\n\\nventricles were collected and placed in culturing medium [2% FBS (Gibco), 1% GlutaMAX Supplement\\n\\n(Gibco) and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (Gibco) in DMEM/F-12]. Subsequently, brain slices were\\n\\nplaced onto 0.4 Î¼m membrane inserts (Millipore) in 6-well plates and cultured for 5 or 9 days in\\n\\nculturing medium, performing medium change every three days.\\n\\nLentiviral production\\n\\nA second generation packaging system was used to generate lentiviral expression particles as previously\\n\\ndescribed (Arbi et al, 2016). The pLV-Dest-CAG lentiviral expression vector was used and was kindly\\n\\n22\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nprovided by Dr. M. Gotz, Helmholtz Center, Munich. The cloning strategy for generating the lentiviral\\n\\nexpression vectors for GFP and GemC1 with an N-terminal GFP tag (GFP-GemC1) was described\\n\\nelsewhere (Arbi et al, 2016).\\n\\nMcIdas with an N-terminal GFP tag (GFP-McIdas) was initially cloned into the KpnI/XhoI restriction\\n\\nsites of the pENTR1AminusCmR vector. p73 with a C-terminal GFP tag (p73-GFP) was initially cloned\\n\\ninto the SalI/NotI restriction sites of the pENTR1AminusCmR vector. An LR recombination reaction,\\n\\nusing the Gateway LR Clonase II enzyme mix (Invitrogen), was performed between the attL-containing\\n\\nentry clone and the attR-containing destination pLVDest-CAG vector.\\n\\nPrimary cultures of postnatal cortical astroglia and lentiviral infection\\n\\nTo establish primary cultures of postnatal cortical astroglia, the cerebral cortex of postnatal P5-P7 wild\\ntype mice was dissected from the brain. Cells were subsequently mechanically dissociated and cultured\\n\\nunder proliferating conditions for 7 days in astro medium containing DMEM/F-12 (Gibco), 10% FBS\\n\\n(Gibco), 2% B27 Supplement (Gibco), 1% GlutaMAX Supplement (Gibco), 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin\\n\\n(Gibco), epidermal growth factor (10ng/ml) and basic fibroblast growth factor (10ng/ml), as previously\\n\\ndescribed (Heinrich et al, 2011).\\n\\nFor lentiviral infection, astroglial cells were plated onto poly-D-lysine pre-coated coverslips 7 days upon\\n\\nproliferation initiation and were left to attach and grow for 2-4 hours. Cells were then transduced with\\n\\nconcentrated lentiviral vectors. The infection mix was removed 24 hours later and was replaced by astro\\n\\nmedium which did not contain FBS, epidermal growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor to favor\\n\\ndifferentiation. Cells were analyzed 7 and 14 days later.\\n\\nPrimary cultures of postnatal radial glial cells and lentiviral infection\\n\\nTo establish primary cultures of postnatal radial glial cells (pRGCs), the lateral walls of the lateral\\n\\nventricles of P0-P1 mice were dissected, mechanically dissociated, and then plated onto poly-D-lysine\\n\\npre-coated coverslips. pRGCs were cultured in proliferation medium [DMEM-high glucose (Gibco),\\n\\n10% FBS (Gibco), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco)] for three days (Paez-Gonzalez et al, 2011;\\n\\nKyrousi et al, 2015; Lalioti et al, 2019b). Subsequently, pRGCs were infected with unconcentrated viral\\n\\nparticles performing plate-spin infection. Proliferation medium was changed 24 hours post-infection and\\n\\nlater replaced with differentiation medium [DMEM-high glucose (Gibco), 2% FBS (Gibco), and 1%\\n\\n23\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\npenicillin/streptomycin (Gibco)] 48 hours post-infection. Cells were processed for analysis 5 or 15 days\\n\\nupon differentiation initiation.\\n\\nCultures of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and transfection\\n\\nMouse embryonic stem cells were grown onto gelatin-coated (0.1% gelatin, Sigma) flasks in GMEM\\n\\nBHK-21 medium (Gibco), supplemented with 10% FBS (Biosera, Embryonic Stem Cells tested), 0.1\\n\\nmM Î²-mercaptoethanol (Gibco), 2 mM L-glutamine (Sigma), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Pan Biotech), 1%\\n\\npenicillin/streptomycin (Gibco), 1% MEM Non-Essential Amino Acids (Biosera) and 2.000 U/ml LIF\\n\\n(Millipore). Cells were passaged every other day and were mycoplasma tested.\\n\\nReverse mESCs transfection was performed using the jet-OPTIMUS reagent according to\\n\\nmanufacturerâs instructions. Briefly, the transfection mixes containing DNA, jet-OPTIMUS buffer and\\n\\ntransfection reagent were prepared. Afterwards, transfection mixes were placed on gelatin pre-coated\\n\\nglass coverslips and then mESCs were immediately seeded. Cells were cultured in the presence of LIF\\n\\nfor 24 hours. The following day the medium was changed (LIF withdrawal), and the cells were cultured\\n\\nin differentiating conditions for up to 6 days and were then processed for analysis.\\n\\nVideo microscopy of ependymal cilia\\n\\nFor the study of ependymal cilia in primary cultures of reprogrammed postnatal cortical astroglia, cells\\n\\nwere grown under proliferating conditions in astro medium for 7 days. Cells were then plated onto poly\\nD-lysine coated glass-bottom dishes (ibidi) and transduced with unconcentrated lentiviral vectors. 24\\n\\nhours post infection, medium was replaced by astro medium which did not contain FBS, epidermal\\n\\ngrowth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor to favor differentiation. Cells were used in video\\n\\nmicroscopy experiments 22 days later.\\n\\nTo perform video microscopy experiments in reprogrammed postnatal cortical astroglia, the culturing\\n\\nmedium was replaced by live imaging medium containing MEM (Sigma), 20% FBS (Gibco), 4 mM L\\nglutamine (Sigma) and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Pan Biotech). In addition, to track cilia generated fluid\\n\\nflow 0.5 Î¼m red fluorescent microbeads (1Î¼l/ml medium; Sigma) were added to the imaging medium.\\n\\nVideo microscopy experiments were performed using an Olympus IX83 microscope equipped with a\\n\\nHamamatsu Orca-Flash 4.0 sCMOS camera. During live imaging microscopy experiments cells were\\n\\nmaintained at 37Â°C and 5% CO2. Videos were obtained using a 60x water immersion objective at 80\\n\\n24\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nframes/sec, while 500 frames were acquired for each field.\\n\\nFor the study of brain ependymal cilia, mice were sacrificed at P7-P15, brains were dissected in HBSS\\n\\nat room temperature and 200 Î¼m thick coronal slices were obtained using a vibrating microtome. Slices\\n\\ncontaining the lateral ventricles were placed in DMEM-GlutaMAX (Gibco) media pre-warmed at 37Â°C.\\n\\nTo perform video microscopy experiments, brain slices were placed onto glass-bottom dishes containing\\n\\nlive imaging medium with 0.5 Î¼m red fluorescent microbeads (1Î¼l/ml medium). Video recordings were\\n\\nobtained as described in the preceding paragraph.\\n\\nFor cilia beat frequency analysis, the ImageJ image processing program was used to firstly generate a\\n\\ngraphical representation of cilia beating, in the form of a kymograph, as previously described by\\n\\nDrummond I. (Drummond, 2009). Cilia beat frequency for each multiciliated cell was then calculated\\n\\nwith the correlation of the time scale of the video recording with the kymograph, following the method\\n\\ndescribed by Francis R. and Lo C. (Francis & Lo, 2013).\\n\\nTo track the trajectory of the moving microbeads the MTrackJ Plugin of the ImageJ program was used.\\n\\nIn short, the point selection tool was used to manually mark the position of each red fluorescent\\n\\nmicrobead in each frame. Consecutive marks on the corresponding video recordings created the\\n\\ntrajectory of the microbeads.\\n\\nWhole-mount dissection\\n\\nSVZ whole mounts were obtained as previously described (Lalioti et al, 2019b). Briefly, the brain was\\n\\nisolated and the electroporated lateral ventricle was carefully separated from the posterior region of the\\n\\ntelencephalon, followed by the extraction of the hippocampus and septum. Fixation of the dissected\\n\\nlateral wall was performed in 4% PFA/0.1% Triton X-100 at 4[o]C overnight. Staining was then performed\\n\\n(see below, immunofluorescence) and the lateral wall was further dissected from the surrounding brain\\n\\nparenchyma, resulting in tissue slivers with a thickness of 200-300 micrometers. These slivers were then\\n\\naffixed to a glass slide using Mowiol 4-88 (Calbiochem) mounting media and covered with a coverslip.\\n\\nImmunofluorescence\\n\\nFor immunofluorescence, cultured cells were fixed for 10 min with 4% PFA (or 10 min PFA 4%\\n\\n25\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nfollowed by 10 min fixation in Methanol where stated) and incubated in blocking solution, for 1hr at\\n\\nroom temperature. Postnatal cortical astroglial cells were incubated in blocking solution containing 5%\\n\\nFBS, 3% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1Ã PBS. pRGCs and mESCs were incubated in blocking solution\\n\\ncontaining 5% Normal Goat Serum (Jackson Immunoresearch) and 0.3% Triton-X100 in 1x PBS. Cells\\n\\nwere incubated with primary antibodies in blocking solution at 4Â°C, overnight (Kalogeropoulou et al,\\n\\n2022).\\n\\nBrains dissected from newborn mice (up to P7) were fixed overnight with 4% PFA. Subsequently,\\n\\nbrains were rinsed with 1x PBS and cryopreserved with incubation in 30% sucrose in 1x PBS for ~48\\n\\nhours. Brains were then frozen in 7.5% gelatin supplemented with 15% sucrose and sectioned at 12 Î¼m\\n\\nusing a CM1850 Leica cryostat. Brain coronal cryosections were postfixed with 4% PFA for 10 min,\\n\\ntreated with 0.3% Triton X-100 in 1Ã PBS for 5 min, and incubated in blocking solution containing 5%\\n\\nFBS, 3% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1Ã PBS, for 1-3 hrs. Samples were incubated with primary\\n\\nantibodies in blocking solution at 4Â°C, overnight.\\n\\nFor immunofluorescence of cultured brain slices, membrane inserts were removed, rinsed in 1x PBS and\\n\\nfixed with 4% PFA at 4Â°C, overnight. Membrane inserts were then subjected to consecutive washes in\\n\\n1x PBS (5 min), 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1Ã PBS (5 min) and 0.5% Triton X-100 in 1Ã PBS (20 min once)\\n\\nand were incubated in blocking solution containing 1% FBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1Ã PBS for 2-3 hrs\\n\\nat room temperature. Samples were incubated with primary antibodies in blocking solution at 4Â°C,\\n\\novernight.\\n\\nImmunofluorescence of SVZ whole-mounts was performed as previously described (Mirzadeh et al,\\n\\n2008, 2010). Briefly, whole-mounts were incubated for 1-2 hrs at room temperature in blocking solution,\\n\\ncontaining 10% normal goat serum in 0.1 M PBS with 0.5-2% Triton-X100. Samples were incubated\\n\\nwith primary antibodies in blocking solution at 4[o]C for 24-48 hrs.\\n\\nThe following primary antibodies were used: chicken anti-GFP (1020, Aves Laboratories, 1:500 for\\n\\nbrain sections; 1:1000 for cells, 1:250 for whole mounts), mouse anti-S100Î² (S2532, Sigma, 1:250),\\n\\nrabbit anti-P73 (ab40658, Abcam, 1:300), mouse anti-FoxJ1 (14-9965, eBioscience, 1:500), rabbit anti\\npericentrin (PRB432C, Covance, 1:750 for brain sections; 1:1500 for cells), rabbit anti-GFAP (Z0334,\\n\\nDakoCytomation, 1:1000 for cells, 1:500 for whole-mounts), mouse anti-acetylated Î±-tubulin (T6793,\\n\\nSigma, 1:1000 for brain sections; 1:1500 for cells), rabbit anti-McIdas ((Pefani et al, 2011), 1:250),\\n\\n26\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nmouse anti-centriolin (sc-365521, Santa Cruz, 1:100, cellsâ fixation in PFA-Methanol), rabbit anti\\nMeig1 (orb185566, Biorbyt, 1:100), rat anti-VCAM1 (550547, BD Biosciences, 1:100), mouse anti Î²\\ncatenin (610153, BD Biosciences, 1:500), guinea pig anti-double-cortin (AB2253, Millipore, 1:500).\\n\\nThe following Alexa Fluor-labeled secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) were used in the respective\\n\\nblocking solution (1:1000) for 1 hr (cryosections and cells) at room temperature or overnight (membrane\\n\\ninserts) at 4Â°C: Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-chicken, Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-mouse IgG1, Alexa Fluor\\n\\n647 donkey anti-rabbit, Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit, Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-mouse IgG1, Alexa\\n\\nFluor 568 goat anti-mouse, Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit, Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-mouse, Alexa\\n\\nFluor 568 goat anti-guinea pig and Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rat. DNA was stained either with Draq-5\\n\\n(1:1000, Biostatus) or Dapi (1:1500, Sigma). Samples were mounted in Mowiol 4-88 (Calbiochem).\\n\\nMicroscopy and data analysis\\n\\nImages of fluorescent samples were acquired with a confocal Leica TCS SP5 and a Leica TCS SP8\\n\\nsystem equipped with a fluorescent Leica DMI600B or Leica DMi8 microscope, respectively. 20x, 40x\\n\\nand 63x lenses were used. Digital images were processed with Adobe Photoshop and the ImageJ image\\n\\nprocessing program. For still images related to video microscopy experiments, individual frames were\\n\\ncropped and adjusted for brightness and contrast in ImageJ.\\n\\nQuantification of cells on overexpressed brains from in vivo experiments was performed on\\n\\ncryosections, vibratome sections or whole-mounts. In all instances, each brain region containing\\n\\nelectroporated cells was imaged and quantified per frame. All quantifications are expressed as\\n\\npercentages of the total cell count. Quantification of radial glial cells, cortical astrocytes, or mESCs from\\n\\nex-vivo experiments was performed in at least two independent experiments, with a minimum of 15\\n\\ndifferent images analyzed for each condition in each experiment.

This has no bearing on the editorial consideration of this\\n\\narticle for publication.\\n\\nTHE PAPER EXPLAINED:\\n\\n28\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nMedical issue\\n\\nHydrocephalus is a condition where fluid builds up in the brain cavities, leading to serious health issues.\\nStandard treatment involves surgery, which is risky and often fails over time. Ependymal cells have\\nmultiple tiny hair-like structures (cilia) on their surface to circulate the fluid, and their impairment may\\nlead to hydrocephalus.\\n\\nResults\\n\\nWe showed that GemC1 and McIdas, which are known regulators of multiciliated ependymal cell fate\\ndetermination, can instruct different cell types to differentiate into ependymal cells. We further managed\\nto convert brain cells of hydrocephalic animal models into ependymal cells.\\n\\nClinical impact\\n\\nOur findings suggest new therapeutic intervention aiming at the regeneration of damaged ependymal\\ncells in human hydrocephalus. .\\n\\nREFERENCES\\n\\nAbdi K, Lai C-H, Paez-Gonzalez P, Lay M, Pyun J & Kuo CT (2018) Uncovering inherent cellular\\n\\nplasticity of multiciliated ependyma leading to ventricular wall transformation and\\nhydrocephalus.

      "Endothelial cell responses to fluid shear stress from blood flow are crucial for vascular development, function and disease. A complex of PECAM-1, VE-cadherin, VEGF receptors (VEGFRs) and PlexinD1 located at cell-cell junctions mediates many of these events. But available evidence suggests that another mechanosensor upstream of PECAM-1 initiates signaling. Hypothesizing that GPCR and GÎ± proteins may serve this role, we performed siRNA screening of GÎ± subunits and found that GÎ±i2 and GÎ±q/11 are required for activation of the junctional complex. We then developed a new activation assay, which showed that these G proteins are activated by flow. We next mapped the GÎ± residues required for activation and developed an affinity purification method that used this information to identify latrophilin-2 (Lphn-2/ADGRL2) as the upstream GPCR. Latrophilin-2 is required for all PECAM-1 downstream events tested. In both mice and zebrafish, latrophilin-2 is required for flow-dependent angiogenesis and artery remodeling. Furthermore, endothelial specific knockout demonstrates that latrophilin plays a role in flow-dependent artery remodeling. Human genetic data reveal a correlation between the latrophilin-2-encoding *Adgrl2* gene and cardiovascular disease. Together, these results define a pathway that connects latrophilin-dependent G protein activation to subsequent endothelial signaling, vascular physiology and disease.\n",

      "\n",
      "Fluid shear stress (FSS) from blood flow is critical for early vascular development in mice(Lucitti *et al*, 2007) and zebrafish(Sugden *et al*, 2017), for homeostatic vessel remodeling in adults(Humphrey & Schwartz, 2021; Vogel *et al*, 2020), and in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis(Baeyens *et al*, 2016; Zhou *et al*, 2014). A complex of proteins at cell-cell junctions consisting of PECAM-1, VE-cadherin, VEGFR2 and 3, and Plexin D1 plays an important role in shear stress responses including vasodilation, flow-dependent vessel remodeling, and atherosclerosis(Conway & Schwartz, 2012; Givens & Tzima, 2016). Stimulation of this junctional complex by flow triggers activation of Src-family kinases (SFKs) within seconds, resulting in ligand-independent activation of VEGF receptors and downstream events including endothelial cell (EC) alignment in the direction of flow(Collins *et al*, 2012). However, the mechanisms by which proteins located at cell-cell junctions can sense forces from shear stress exerted on the apical surface is unclear. Previous work suggests that activation of the junctional complex is not primary but rather requires an upstream event, mediated presumably by another mechanosensor (Conway *et al*, 2013).\n",
      "\n",
      "GPCR/GÎ± protein signaling is an obvious candidate for initiating signaling on this time scale (seconds). GPCRs are a large family of cell surface receptors that play a crucial role in transducting signals across cell membranes. GPCRs undergo conformational changes in response to ligand binding or other stimuli, after which the activated intracellular domain binds to a heterotrimeric GÎ± protein complex and catalyzes the exchange of guanosine diphosphate (GDP) for guanosine triphosphate (GTP). Connections between GPCRs and shear stress have been reported(Chachisvilis *et al*, 2006; Dela Paz & Frangos, 2019; Erdogmus *et al*, 2019; Jung *et al*, 2012; Wang *et al*, 2015; Xu *et al*, 2018). However, the literature on GÎ± proteins and GPCRs in shear stress signaling is highly inconsistent(Chachisvilis *et al.*, 2006; Dela Paz & Frangos, 2019; Jung *et al.*, 2012; Wang *et al.*, 2015). For instance, it has been demonstrated that flow applied to endothelial cells activates GÎ± proteins independent of an intervening GPCR(Dela Paz *et al*, 2017; Gudi *et al*, 1998). It has also been reported that shear stress responses related to PECAM-1 and cell-cell junction require GPCRs but with different GPCRs implicated in different studies. These studies include reports of ligand-independent activation of a bradykinin receptor(Chachisvilis *et al.*, 2006; Yeh *et al*, 2008) and the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor S1PR1(Jung *et al.*, 2012). The purinergic receptor P2Y2 was also implicated, in this case via ATP release downstream of activation of the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1(Albarran-Juarez *et al*, 2018; Wang *et al.*, 2015), though this pathway has been disputed(Dela Paz & Frangos, 2019). The orphan receptor GPR68 was identified as a shear stress sensor specific to small arteries though the mechanism of activation, including ligand dependence or independence, is unknown(Xu *et al.*, 2018). These studies also vary in the GÎ± proteins implicated, which included different GÎ±i isoforms (Gudi *et al*, 1996; Jung *et al.*, 2012) and the GÎ±q/11 family(Albarran-Juarez *et al.*, 2018; Chachisvilis *et al.*, 2006; Wang *et al.*, 2015).\n",
      "\n",
      "To resolve this issue, we took an unbiased approach starting from the GÎ± proteins using the dramatic morphological changes in endothelial alignment to flow as the initial readout. Our results showed that GÎ±i2 and GÎ±q/11 function in parallel, identified latrophilin-2 (LPHN2) as the key upstream GPCR and demonstrated a specific requirement for LPHN2 in flow-dependent remodeling in zebrafish and mice.\n",

      "Identification of GÎ± protein subunits required for flow sensing\n",
      "\n",
      "To investigate the roles of GPCR signaling in endothelial flow responses, we first transfected human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to suppress Gs, Gi, Gq/11 and G12/13 classes of GÎ± proteins and assayed EC alignment in flow as our initial readout. Single knockdowns gave either weak (Gi) or no (Gs, G12/13, Gq/11) inhibition of EC alignment in flow (Fig.1A and Appendix fig. S1A-C). However, simultaneous knockdown of Gi and Gq/11 completely inhibited alignment (Fig. 1A), whereas other combinations were ineffective (Appendix fig. S1D, S1E). Activation of SFKs is the earliest flow-responsive event mediated by PECAM-1, followed by VEGFRs and Akt(Tzima *et al*, 2005). These events were similarly blocked by knockdown of Gi plus Gq/11 but not by single knockdowns (Fig. 1B, 1C and Appendix fig. S1F). Therefore, Gi and Gq/11 act in parallel to initiate PECAM-1-dependent flow signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rescue controls with siRNA-resistant GÎ± variants showed that siRNA-resistant Gq and Gi2 restored cell alignment, whereas Gi1 and Gi3 did not (Fig. 1D and Appendix fig. S2A, S2B). This unexpected result prompted us to search for residues that are similar in Gq and Gi2 but different in Gi1 and Gi3. Two residues (using human Gi2 numbering) fit this pattern: D167 in Gi2 corresponds to N in Gi1/3; and K307 corresponds to Q306 in Gi1/3 (Fig. 1E). Gi1(Q306K), but not Gi1(N166D), rescued EC alignment in flow (Fig. 1F and Appendix fig. S2C). Consistently, Gi2 mutant lacking K307 (K307Q) could not rescue the defects on flow-induced alignment under the knockdown of Gi plus Gq/11 (Appendix fig. S1G and Appendix fig. S2D). Therefore, K307 in Gi2 distinguishes the GÎ± subunits participate in flow signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flow-induced activation of specific GÎ± proteins\n",
      "\n",
      "K307 lies in the region that specifies coupling with GPCRs(Bae *et al*, 1999; Flock *et al*, 2017), suggesting that K307 may determine GÎ± activation. However, testing this hypothesis requires measurement of GÎ± activation in live cells. Unfortunately, indirect GÎ± activation assays using second messengers such as cAMP or calcium are unreliable in the context of fluid shear stress where multiple activating/suppressing pathways are stimulated. We therefore developed pulldown assays for GÎ± based on the specific binding of GTP-loaded GÎ± subunits to effector proteins, namely GINIP for Gi and GRK2 N-terminal domain for Gq (Appendix fig. S3a)(Gaillard *et al*, 2014; Tesmer *et al*, 2005). To facilitate these assays and distinguish specific GÎ± isoforms (especially Gi isoforms), we prepared versions containing an internal GluGlu (EE) epitope tag that does not impair function (Appendix fig. S3B and refs(Medina *et al*, 1996; Wilson & Bourne, 1995)). For Gq, to enhance pulldown efficiency, we co-expressed Ric8A, which stabilizes active Gq(Papasergi *et al*, 2015). Active, but not inactive, Gi and Gq bound to these effector proteins, while when the artificial GPCR DREADD was expressed, its ligand clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) also activated GÎ± proteins (Appendix fig. S3C-S3F). Importantly, this GÎ± pulldown assay showed not only rapid activation of Gi2 and Gq by FSS (Fig. 1G-J), but also differential responses of Gi1 and gain-of-function Gi1(Q306K) to FSS (Fig. 1K, 1L). Gi activation was unaffected by PECAM-1 knockdown, indicating that this step was upstream or independent of PECAM-1 (Fig. 1M, 1N). Flow-mediated activation of specific GÎ± subunits thus corresponds to their requirement in EC flow responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Identification of the upstream GPCR\n",
      "\n",
      "We next sought to identify the GPCR(s) that mediates flow activation of Gi2 and Gq/11. Although affinity purification is the obvious choice, rapid release of GÎ± proteins from GPCRs after GTP loading limits this approach. Starting with wild-type and its Q306K mutant, we inserted 1) an internal GFP for affinity purification and 2) four alanines (hereafter ins4A) into helix Î±5, which blocks GTP loading, thereby preventing dissociation from GPCRs even in the presence of GTP(Kaya *et al*, 2016) (Fig. 2A). Both constructs localized mainly to the plasma membrane, as did wild-type GÎ± (Appendix fig. S4A). We further employed detergent-free nanodisc-forming styrene-maleimide anhydride (SMA) copolymer to stabilize GPCR conformation within its native lipid environment(Lee *et al*, 2016). This approach was validated by coimmunoprecipitation using GFP-TrapÂ® nanobody beads of GÎ± variants with DREADD GPCR, which showed increased association after receptor activation (Appendix fig. S4B, S4C). Proteomic analysis for GPCRs that associated with Gi1(Q306K) but not wild-type Gi1 in response to FSS (protocol in Appendix fig. S4D), identified S1PR1 and ADGRL3 (Appendix fig. S4E). However, depletion of S1PR1 did not block alignment in FSS (Appendix fig. S4F, S4G). Furthermore, S1PR1 reportedly activates Gi1 and Gi3 as well as Gi2(Lee *et al*, 1996), which is inconsistent with the GÎ± specificity defined above. We therefore focused on ADGRL family proteins, also called latrophilins (LPHNs).\n",
      "\n",
      "Latrophilins (1,2 and 3 in mammals) are adhesion-type GPCRs that bind to counterreceptors on neighboring cells and regulate neuronal synapses(Sando *et al*, 2019). Although it has been reported that different types of endothelial cells have different latrophilin isoforms, LPHN2 is most widely expressed and is the overwhelming major isoform in HUVECs (Appendix figs S5A)(Maleszewska *et al*, 2016). Consistent with the proteomic results, Gi1(Q306K)(ins4A) associated with endogenous LPHN2, which increased upon FSS (Fig. 2B, C). This result strongly suggests that FSS activates LPHN2 to recruit GÎ± proteins. Furthermore, Gi1(Q306K), Gi2, and Gq co-immunoprecipitated with LPHN2, whereas Gi1 did not, indicating that LPHN2 specifically bound to the flow-responsive GÎ± proteins defined above (Fig. 2D). Importantly, LPHN2 knockdown blocked flow-mediated activation of Gi2 (Fig. 2E, 2F). Together, these data provide strong evidence that latrophilin-2 mediates GÎ± activation essential for endothelial alignment in response to flow.\n",

      "Latrophilins in EC flow signaling *in vitro*.\n",

      "Knockdown of LPHN2, but not LPHN1 or LPHN3, blocked EC alignment in flow (Fig. 3A, 3B; knockdown confirmed in Appendix fig. S5B, S5C). LPHN2 knockdown in human aortic ECs similarly blocked flow-induced alignment (Appendix fig. S5D, S5E). In line with these results, LPHN2 knockdown also blocked Golgi apparatus polarization in flow (Appendix fig. S5F, S5G). LPHN2 localized to cell-cell contacts (Fig.3C and Appendix fig. S6). The flow responsive G1 mutant, Gi1(Q306K), also associated with PECAM-1 following FSS (Fig. 3D). The association between LPHN2-Gi1(Q306K) complex with junctional mechanosensory complex proteins PECAM-1 and VE-Cadherin was detected after 24 hours of flow (Fig. 3D-3G), indicating a persistent interaction. We also assessed the immediate flow-dependent signals. LPHN2 depletion strongly suppressed flow-mediated acute activation of SFKs and Akt (Fig 3H-3J). Thus, LPHN2 colocalizes, physically associates with and is required for signaling through the junctional complex. However, LPHN2 knockdown did not inhibit activation of VEGFR2 by VEGF-A, indicating that LPHN2 functions specifically in response to laminar flow (Appendix fig. S7A, S7B).\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the 3 latrophilin isoforms in human genome, all rescued flow-mediated endothelial alignment after LPHN2 knockdown (Fig. 3K, expression confirmed in Appendix fig. S8A), indicating functional equivalence; the observed differences are therefore due to differential expression. EC alignment was rescued by wild type (WT) LPHN2 but not H1071A, which is defective in coupling to GÎ± proteins(Nazarko *et al*, 2018) (Fig. 3L, expression confirmed in Appendix fig. S8B). Adhesion-type GPCRs can be activated by internal cleavage by the extracellular GAIN domain which exposures its *Stachel* peptide as a tethered agonist(Vizurraga *et al*, 2020). However, the autoproteolysis-defective mutant fully rescued EC alignment (see Fig.3L). Helix-8 is known to endow some GPCRs with mechanosensitivity to membrane stretch(Erdogmus *et al.*, 2019). However, a LPHN2 helix-8 mutant could still rescue EC alignment in flow (Fig. 3L). Taken together, these findings indicate that latrophilin regulates GÎ± activation required for endothelial flow responses, but activation requires neither the *Stachel* peptide nor helix-8.\n",

      "Latrophilin-2 regulates flow-induced endothelial cell morphological changes *in vivo*\n",
      "\n",
      "Long-term laminar flow stabilizes EC junctions, promoting a linear, continuous morphology associated with barrier function(Kroon *et al*, 2017) (see Fig.3A). To test whether the role of LPHN2 in this process, we analyzed junctional morphology *in vitro* with and without 16h of flow. In control cells, shear stress shifted junctions from an irregular morphology to linear junctions; in Lphn2 knockdown ECs, junctions were indistinguishable in the absence of flow but failed to linearize in flow (Fig. 4A, 4B), demonstrating that the effect is flow-specific. To further examine contributions of blood flow/latrophilin-2 to ECs *in vivo,* zebrafish embryos are useful as a developmental system that is amenable to manipulation of shear stress using morpholinos against cardiac troponin T type 2a (tnnt2a; â*silent heart*â)(Sehnert *et al*, 2002), without global adverse effects. We employed zebrafish embryos expressing Tg(*kdrl:ras-mCherry*) to mark endothelial cells(Sehnert *et al.*, 2002) and designed sgRNAs for CRISPR-Cas9 targeting all latrophilin isoforms (*adgrl1*, *adgrl2a* plus *adgrl2b.1*, and *adgrl3*). Our sgRNAs induced >50% cleavage in the T7 endonuclease assays and reduced mRNA levels through nonsense-mediated decay (Appendix fig. S9). Since Lphn2 is the major endothelial isoform, we performed CRISPR-mediated F(0)/mosaic knockout of *adgrl2a*+*adgrl2b.1* (hereafter Lphn2 mutation), which inhibited elongation and enlargement of ECs in the dorsal aorta (Fig. 4C). Injecting single cell embryos with *silent heart* morpholinos at a dose that completely blocked cardiac contractility similarly blocked the elongation of ECs. Furthermore, combining tnnt2a and Lphn2 mutation had no further effect, supporting a specific role for latrophilins in flow sensing (Fig. 4D, 4E).\n",
      "\n",
      "To address LPHN function in mammals, we crossed Lphn2flox/flox mice with CDH5-CreERT2 mice (Lphn2 ECKO), which were injected with tamoxifen at 8 weeks of age and remained viable 10 weeks later. The descending thoracic aorta (a region of high laminar flow) of Lphn2 ECKO mice had poorly aligned ECs with irregular junctions (Fig. 4F-H). Additionally, Lphn2 ECKO increased vascular permeability in the whole aorta, as assessed by Evans blue extravasation (Fig. 4I, 4J). *In vitro*, flow for 24h increased HUVEC barrier function, which was blocked by LPHN2 knockdown, whereas barrier function in the absence of flow was unaffected (Fig. 4K, 4L). Latrophilins are therefore flow-responsive GPCRs that regulate multiple steps in PECAM1-dependent EC mechanotransduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plasma membrane fluidization initiates latrophilin signaling\n",
      "\n",
      "We next considered how FSS activates LPHN2. As mutation of the autoproteolytic GAIN domain, which is speculated to be mechanosensitive, had no effect (Figure 3i), we considered alternatives. FSS induces a rapid increase in plasma membrane fluidity, in some cases associated with decreased plasma membrane cholesterol(Butler *et al*, 2001; Haidekker *et al*, 2000; Yamamoto & Ando, 2013; Yamamoto *et al*, 2020). As GPCRs can respond to such changes(Vizurraga *et al.*, 2020), HUVECs were treated with methyl-Î²-cyclodextrin (MÎ²CD) to extract plasma membrane cholesterol. Treatment with 5 mM MÎ²CD for 1 min reduced plasma membrane cholesterol to the same extent as flow, assayed by binding of the cholesterol-specific probe D4H-Clover3(Liu *et al*, 2017) (Figure 5A). No discernable effect on cytoskeletal organization was observed under these conditions (Figure 5B). MÎ²CD treatment also induced GÎ± binding to LPHN2 (Figure 5C) and activated both SFKs and VEGFR2, which were blocked by LPHN2 knockdown (Figure 5D-F). Together with published data demonstrating that cholesterol supplementation blocks flow signaling to these and related pathways(Fancher *et al*, 2018; Tirziu *et al*, 2005; Yamamoto & Ando, 2013, 2015; Yamamoto *et al.*, 2020), these results suggest that membrane fluidization can trigger LPHN2 GPCR activation and downstream signaling (Figure 5G).\n",

      "To address roles of LPHN2 in flow-dependent vascular remodeling, we examined zebrafish embryos, where artery lumen diameters are determined by EC shear stress(Sugden *et al.*, 2017). We observed that intersegmental vessels (ISVs) at 48 hours post fertilization had reduced diameters after both latrophilin knockout and blockade of blood flow, with no further effect when combined (Fig. 6A, 6B). At 72 hpf, when intersegmental arteries and veins are distinguishable, the decrease in diameter was observed only in arteries (Fig. 6C). LPHNs are thus required for effects of flow on artery diameter.\n",
      "\n",
      "These results prompted us to examine flow-dependent vascular remodeling in mice. Femoral artery ligation triggers flow-driven arteriogenesis in the thigh and hypoxia-driven angiogenesis in the calf(Cornella *et al*, 2017). Following surgery, LPHN2 ECKO mice showed lower blood flow in the foot even at day 1 and markedly slower recovery than WT littermates (Fig. 6D, 6E). To understand these effects, we performed micro-CT of vascular casts after injection of electron-dense bismuth microparticles that label arteries/arterioles but not capillaries due to particle size. Surgery induced an increase in small arteries in WT mice but essentially none in LPHN2 ECKO mice (Fig. 6F, 6G). LPHN2 ECKO mice also had much lower density of small arteries even in the control leg, consistent with lower flow on day 1. Staining for PECAM to examine the total vasculature in leg muscle sections revealed decreased capillary density as well, even at baseline (Fig. 6H, 6I). LPHN2 ECKO mice thus show low vascular density at baseline and greatly reduced flow-dependent remodeling. As expected from the low vascular density, a treadmill fatigue test (Fig. 6J) LPHN2 ECKO mice showed markedly lower exercise capacity (Fig. 6K, 6L) and impaired oxygen consumption (Fig. 6M). LPHN2 ECKO thus results in vascular defects *in vivo*, at least in part due to defective EC flow sensing. To address whether these defects were related to shear stress sensing, we examined an *in vitro* system in which FSS enhances VEGF-induced sprouting into collagen gels(Galie *et al*, 2014). Enhanced sprouting was completely blocked by LPHN2 depletion with only a weak effect on basal migration (Fig. 6N-6P).\n",

      "The Cardiovascular Disease Knowledge Portal reported four SNPs near the 5â end of the *ADGRL2* gene (Appendix fig. S10A) that exhibit genome wide association with hypertension (Appendix fig. S10B). All 4 are in close proximity to each other and are in linkage disequilibrium (Dâ: 0.9953, R2: 0.97). Two of the SNPs meet the significant threshold (p<5 x 10-8) and rs1195871 is relatively conserved among vertebrates. Of particular interest, the intronic SNP rs186892211 in the *ADGRL2* locus (Appendix fig. S10A) is associated with large-artery atherosclerosis and subsequent ischemic stroke (TOAST classification) with a very high odds ratio (odds ratio 720; p< 3.134e-10, Appendix fig. S10B).\n",

      "**Discussion**\n",
      "\n",
      "These data elucidate a pathway in which fluid shear stress acts through the latrophilin adhesion GPCRs to activate subsequent cellular signaling events and vascular remodeling *in vivo,* thus connecting time scales from seconds to hours to weeks/months. Previous studies showed that laminar flow induces an increase in plasma membrane fluidity associated with depletion of membrane cholesterol (Yamamoto & Ando, 2013, 2015; Yamamoto *et al.*, 2020). Our data demonstrate that artificial cholesterol depletion activates flow-induced signals in a Lphn2-dependent manner, suggesting that latrophilins connect physical changes in the plasma membrane to cellular signaling. Latrophilins mediate activation of the PECAM-1/VE-cadherin/VEGFR pathway through both Gi2 and Gq/11, suggesting parallel or redundant downstream pathways. Consistent with these functional effects, FSS induces physical interactions (direct or indirect) between LPHN2-GÎ± and PECAM-1. However, LPHNs are not required for activation of VEGFRs by its ligand VEGF.\n",
      "\n",
      "Previous studies identified either Gi or Gq/11 as mediators of flow signaling(Chachisvilis *et al.*, 2006; Jung *et al.*, 2012; Wang *et al.*, 2015). It seems plausible that, depending on EC subtype or experimental conditions, either Gi or Gq/11 predominated, which concealed their functional redundancy. Previous studies also identified other GPCRs as mediators of EC shear stress responses, via direct or indirect mechanisms, as well as making claims for GPCR-independent activation of G proteins(Dela Paz *et al.*, 2017). GPCRs implicated in shear stress signaling include bradykinin receptor B2(Chachisvilis *et al.*, 2006), ATP receptor P2Y2(Albarran-Juarez *et al.*, 2018; Wang *et al.*, 2015), sphingosine phosphate receptor S1PR1(Jung *et al.*, 2012), the apelin receptor APJ(Strohbach *et al*, 2018) and GPR68(Xu *et al.*, 2018). An indirect association of Gq/11 with PECAM1 was also reported, which dissociated upon application of shear stress(dela Paz *et al*, 2014). Differences in EC location or subtype likely account for some of these effects. For example, GPR68 is expressed specifically in small resistance arteries where it controls vasodilation but had no reported effect on development or patterning(Xu *et al.*, 2018). P2Y2 was also reported to affect vasodilation and blood pressure without reported effects on development or patterning. It seems likely that differences in local expression may thus explain some of the apparent multiplicity, though additional variables such as modulation by other inputs and coupling to different downstream effectors may also contribute. Understanding this GPCR-GÎ± protein signaling network is therefore an important though complex direction for future work. The novel pulldown assay and GPCR-GÎ± protein affinity purification protocol developed here may facilitate such efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is also noteworthy that latrophilins are required only for activation of signaling events including VEGFR2 by flow, but not for activation of VEGFR2 by its ligand, VEGF. PECAM-1 first appears in vertebrates but has multiple other functions in leukocyte transmigration and activation, platelet reactivity and angiogenesis that are independent of flow(Privratsky *et al*, 2010). Together, these findings argue that latrophilins, in essence, confer flow sensitivity to pre-existing pathways controlled by ligand availability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lphn2 mutation in zebrafish and endothelial knockout in mice caused multiple vascular defects that implicate FSS mechanotransduction, including reduced EC alignment in the direction of flow, altered junctional morphology and permeability, smaller artery diameters and defects in arterialization in the hindlimb ischemia model. Lower capillary and small artery density in some vascular beds may also be attributable to defective FSS sensing, as FSS regulates angiogenic sprouting (Galie *et al.*, 2014) and stabilizes nascent vessels once blood begins to flow (Campinho *et al*, 2020). We note, however, that flow-independent functional roles for Lphn2 in ECs have been observed (Camillo *et al*, 2021) and likely contribute as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "These results link together many observations to provide a comprehensive model for EC responses to FSS (Appendix fig. S11). These findings are of further interest in light of human genetic data that strongly link the *Adgrl2* gene to vascular disease (Appendix fig. S10). However, the identified polymorphisms reside in regulatory or intronic regions, thus, causal connections to vascular disease are not obvious. Intronic polymorphisms can regulate gene expression but could also be in linkage disequilibrium with causal SNPs that are not yet identified. More detailed population genetic analyses are required to address these issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "These findings open many important questions for future work. Structural insights into latrophilin activation are needed, as are insights into the contribution of the large extracellular domain. The parallel roles of Gi2 and Gq/11 and downstream effectors remain to be understood. Thorough analysis of latrophilin functions in vascular development and physiology remains to be done. Lastly, combined human genetic and structure-function studies are needed to elucidate the contribution of Lphn2 variants to human cardiovascular disease.\n",

Cells were stained with Hoechst (Invitrogen: H1399) to label nuclei. Images of stained vessels were acquired using a Leica SP8 confocal microscope with the Leica Application Suite (LAS) software. Endothelial cell alignment in aorta was quantified by measuring the eccentricity of the immunostaining of beta-catenin of the endothelial cells (>150 cells per field of view).\n",

      "\n",
      "For aortic vascular permeability measurements, Evans blue dye (20 mg/ml in saline, 2.5 Âµl/g mouse body weight) (Sigma E2129) was injected retro-orbitally to LPHN2 endothelial cell-specific knockout and their control littermates at 8 weeks old. Thirty minutes post injection, animals were euthanized by an overdose of isoflurane and tissue samples including aorta were harvested and washed with PBS to remove extra fatty tissues. Dissected aorta was prepared *en face* and imaged with an Olympus stereo zoom microscope. To quantify blue color associated with extravasation of Evans blue dye, the original RGB images were converted into HSV color model, and the proportion of the blue regions was calculated as the ratio of pixels with hue angles of 120Â°-240Â° to the entire aorta.\n",

      "\n",
      "Mice were anesthetized and operated with a mixture of 1.5-2% isoflurane. The front hair of the right thigh was removed with Nair lotion and the local surgical area was disinfected. A 5 mm longitudinal skin incision was made in the right thigh. The distal femoral artery, proximal to the popliteal artery and saphenous artery, was explored and dissected. 6-0 silk sutures (Syneture) were double used for the ligation before excision of the arterial vessel bed between the distal end of the superficial epigastric artery and the trifurcation of the femoral artery into the descending genicular, popliteal, and saphenous branches. The ligated artery was cut between two sutures. The venous structures and accompanying peripheral nerves were kept intact. The overlying skin was closed with a 6-0 prolene (Ethicon) and disinfected. At the end of the procedure, Buprenorphine was administered subcutaneously at 0.05 mg/kg, once pre-emptively, then every 12 h for 72 h. The survival rate for this surgery was 100%.\n",

      "\n",
      "Hindlimb perfusion was assessed noninvasively in the plantar foot before, 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21 days after hindlimb ischemia by scanning laser-Doppler [model LDI2-IR modified for high resolution; Moor Instruments, Wilmington, DE]. The hindquarters were placed on the top of a heater pad during scanning to minimize variation in body temperature. Doppler perfusion of the plantar foot was assessed within anatomically defined regions of interest (ROIs; Moor Instruments). The ROI for the plantar foot consisted of the hind paw margins. Procedures for minimal preparation, scanning, and ROI selections have been described in detail previously(Zhuang *et al*, 2011). Low or no perfusion is displayed as dark blue, whereas the highest degree of perfusion is displayed as red. These images were quantitatively converted into histograms that represented the amount of blood flow on the x-axis and the number of pixels on the y-axis in the traced area. The average blood flow in each histogram was calculated and the LDI index was determined as the ratio of ischemic to non-ischemic hindlimb blood perfusion.\n",

      "After the mice were euthanized, the vasculature was flushed with 0.9% normal saline containing heparin (1000 IU/L) for 3 minutes, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 minutes at 100 mm Hg pressure. Fresh home-made 20% bismuth nanoparticles mixed in 5% gelatin were used as a micro-CT contrast agent and injected over 2 minutes with a syringe pump, as described before(Tirziu *et al.*, 2005). The mice were then immediately chilled on ice for more than 30 min and immersion-fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde overnight. The peripheral vasculature in the ischemic hindlimb and the contralateral normal hindlimb was imaged with a high-resolution micro-CT imaging system (GE eXplore Locus SP), set to a 0.007-mm effective detector pixel size. Microview software (GE Healthcare) was used for initial reconstruction. Advanced workstation with various software was used for 3D reconstruction and segmentation of the whole hindlimb at the 21 Âµm spatial resolution. Using the knee as the breakpoint, we re-sliced the 3D vasculature into 200 slices both in the thigh and in the calf regions. Quantification was performed by use of a NIH Image. The data were expressed as vascular segment numbers, representing the total number of vessels, of specified diameter, counted in 200Â *z*-sections for the thigh region and another 200Â *z*-sections for the calf region.\n",

      "Mice were first acclimatized by staying on the motionless treadmill machine for 30 min on day 1 and then trained on the treadmill moving at 12 m/min for 30 min on day 2. Fatigue tests were then conducted on days 3 and 4. Â Mice were placed on the treadmill and the shock rod was activated. Â Treadmill speeds were increased as follows: 0 m/min, for 12 min to measure basal metabolism, 12 m/min, for1 min, then increasing at a rate of +1 m/min each 1 min until exhaustion. Â Exhaustion (endpoint of treadmill cessation) was defined as the point at which mice continuously contacted with the shock rod for 5 continuous seconds or when mice stopped running 3 times within 5 seconds. Before each testing session, Oxymax software (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH, USA) and open circuit indirect calorimetry treadmills (Metabolic Modular Treadmill, Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH) were calibrated and checked for hardware malfunctions according to manufacturer instructions.\n",

      "The C2-WW-HECT domain ubiquitin ligase Nedd4L regulates membrane sorting during endocytosis through the ubiquitination of cargo molecules such as the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). Nedd4L is catalytically autoinhibited by an intramolecular interaction between its C2 and HECT domains, but the proteinâs activation mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we show that Nedd4L activation is linked to membrane shape by FCHO2, a Bin-Amphiphysin-Rsv (BAR) domain protein that regulates endocytosis. FCHO2 was required for the Nedd4L-mediated ubiquitination and endocytosis of ENaC, with Nedd4L co-localizing with FCHO2 at clathrin-coated pits. In cells, Nedd4L was specifically recruited to, and activated by, the FCHO2 BAR domain. Furthermore, we reconstituted FCHO2-induced recruitment and activation of Nedd4L in vitro. Both the recruitment and activation were mediated by membrane curvature rather than protein-protein interactions. The Nedd4L C2 domain recognized a specific degree of membrane curvature that was generated by the FCHO2 BAR domain, with this curvature directly activating Nedd4L by relieving its autoinhibition. Thus, we show for the first time a specific function (i.e., recruitment and activation of an enzyme regulating cargo sorting) of membrane curvature by a BAR domain protein.\n",

      "\n",
      "Posttranslational modification of proteins by covalent attachment of ubiquitin (Ub) is catalyzed by three enzymes: a Ub-activating enzyme (E1), a Ub-conjugating enzyme (E2), and a Ub-protein ligase (E3) that determines substrate specificity (Hershko & Ciechanover, 1998). E3 Ub ligases are classified into two categories based on their Ub transfer mechanisms: RING finger/U-box E3 and HECT-type E3. The Nedd4 family belongs to HECT-type E3 Ub ligases and consists of nine members, including Nedd4/Nedd4-1, Nedd4L/Nedd4-2, Itch, Smurf1, Smurf2, WWP1, WWP2, NEDL1, and NEDL2 (Ingham et al, 2004; Rotin & Kumar, 2009). They are characterized by a common modular organization, with an N-terminal C2 domain, two to four WW domains, and a C-terminal catalytic HECT domain. While the C2 domain was originally identified in protein kinase C (PKC) as a Ca2+-dependent phosphatidylserine (PS)-binding domain (Nishizuka, 1992), it shows significant diversity in the binding partners, including intracellular proteins and other phospholipids, such as phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] (Lemmon, 2008). The WW domains recognize proline-rich motifs, such as PPxY (PY motif, where x is any residue), of substrates or adaptor proteins. The HECT domain catalyzes the isopeptide bond formation between the Ub C terminus and the substrate lysine residues. At least some of the Nedd4 family members, including Nedd4L, are catalytically autoinhibited by an intramolecular interaction between the C2 and HECT domains (Wang et al, 2010; Wiesner et al, 2007; Zhu et al, 2017). However, the activation mechanism of the Nedd4 family is poorly understood.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Nedd4 family is implicated in a wide variety of cellular processes by regulating membrane trafficking and degradation of components of various signaling pathways (Ingham et al, 2004; Rotin & Kumar, 2009). Among a diversity of substrates, the best-characterized is the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). This channel is composed of three subunits, Î±-, Î²-, and Î³ENaC, each of which possesses two transmembrane segments and intracellular N- and C-termini with a large extracellular loop (Butterworth, 2010; Rotin & Staub, 2011; Rossier, 2014). Each subunit has a PY motif at the cytosolic C-terminus. Nedd4L Ub ligase specifically binds to the PY motif and mediates the ubiquitination of lysine residues on the N-terminus of at least Î±- and Î³ENaC at the plasma membrane. Ub serves as an internalization signal for recognition by adaptor proteins, such as epsin and Eps15, for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) (Traub, 2009). Consequently, ENaC is constitutively internalized through CME. Heterozygous mutations of the PY motif of Î²- or Î³ENaC lead to impaired ubiquitination and endocytosis, resulting in persistence of the channels at the cell surface and increased Na+ absorption in Liddle syndrome, an autosomal dominant form of severe hypertension.\n",
      "\n",
      "The process of CME begins at the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane with the assembly of clathrin with adaptor proteins and transmembrane cargo molecules (Doherty & McMahon, 2009; Traub, 2009). In parallel with this assembly, membrane curvature is generated to form hemispherical clathrin-coated pits (CCPs). This process leads to deep membrane invaginations. Subsequently, the neck of invaginated pits is constricted and severed to separate the newly formed clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) from the plasma membrane. These membrane curvatures are considered to be generated, sensed, and/or maintained by Bin-Amphiphysin-Rsv (BAR) domain superfamily proteins. BAR domains form a crescent-shaped dimer characterized by a specific degree of intrinsic curvature. They bind to negatively charged phospholipids, such as PS, and force membranes to bend according to their intrinsic curvatures, thereby inducing the formation of membrane tubules with specific diameters (curvatures). For example, the diameters of membrane tubules generated by the amphiphysin BAR domain, FCHO2 BAR domain, and FBP17 BAR domain are 20â50 nm (sharper curvature) (Peter et al, 2004; Takei et al, 1999; Yin et al, 2009), 50â80 nm (intermediate curvature) (Henne et al, 2007), and ~150 nm (Takano et al, 2008) (shallower curvature), respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "The FCHO2 BAR domain has been proposed to trigger the initial invagination for CCP formation (Henne et al, 2010). FCHO2 binds to the flat surface of the plasma membrane at sites where CCPs will form. FCHO2 then generates the initial membrane curvature and recruits the clathrin machinery for CCP formation. Here, we report the role of FCHO2 in Nedd4L-mediated ENaC endocytosis and show that FCHO2 BAR domain-generated membrane curvature induces the recruitment and activation of Nedd4L.\n",

      "\n",
      "To study the role of FCHO2 in ENaC endocytosis, we established a HeLa cell line stably expressing all three subunits, Î±-, Î²-, and Î³ENaC (Î±Î²Î³ENaC-HeLa cells) (Fig EV1A-C). A FLAG tag was introduced into the extracellular region of Î±ENaC in a position previously shown not to affect channel activity (Firsov et al, 1996). Upon FCHO2 knockdown by small interfering RNA (siRNA) methods, ENaC internalization was reduced, as was upon Nedd4L knockdown (Zhou et al, 2007) (Fig 1 A and B). Transferrin receptor (TfR) internalization was reduced upon FCHO2 knockdown but not upon Nedd4L knockdown (Fig 1C). The phenotype of FCHO2 knockdown in ENaC internalization was rescued by an siRNA-resistant (sr) form of FCHO2 (Fig 1D and Appendix Fig S1). Furthermore, Î±ENaC ubiquitination was reduced upon FCHO2 or Nedd4L knockdown but not upon FBP17 knockdown (Fig 1E and Fig EV2). FCHO2 or Nedd4L knockdown increased Î±ENaC expression at the cell surface (Fig 1E and F). These results suggest that FCHO2 is required for Nedd4L-mediated ubiquitination and endocytosis of ENaC.\n",

      "Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that in Î±Î²Î³ENaC-HeLa cells, cell-surface Î±ENaC co-localized with FCHO2 at clathrin-coated structures (Fig 2A). However, its co-localization with Nedd4L was not detected (Appendix Fig S2A), because exogenous expression of Nedd4L-green fluorescent protein (GFP) stimulated ENaC internalization, resulting in the disappearance of Î±ENaC from the cell surface. Cell-surface Î±ENaC was observed in cells lacking Nedd4L-GFP expression (non-transfected cells). When a catalytically inactive Nedd4L mutant, C922A, was expressed, it co-localized with cell-surface Î±ENaC and endogenous FCHO2 (Fig 2B). The mutant also formed FCHO2-negative spots. In wild-type HeLa cells, Nedd4L accumulated at clathrin-coated structures where FCHO2 localized (Fig 2C). Additionally, Nedd4L formed clathrin-negative spots, suggesting that they may be involved in clathrin-independent endocytosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, we investigated whether Nedd4L is recruited to CCPs in wild-type HeLa cells. Similar to FCHO2 described previously (Henne et al, 2010; Lehmann et al, 2019; Zaccai et al, 2022), Nedd4L showed dynamic co-localization with clathrin during pit formation (Fig 3). When both fluorescent protein-tagged FCHO2 and Nedd4L were expressed, the accumulation of Nedd4L at FCHO2-positive spots was not clearly observed (Appendix Fig S2B). The reason behind this remains unknown, but it has been shown that clathrin coat formation, measured in time-lapse images of cells expressing fluorescent proteins, is affected by several factors, such as overexpression level, choice of the proteins, and choice of the fluorescent tag (Aguet et al, 2013). These factors may contribute to the failure to detect the accumulation of Nedd4L at FCHO2-positive spots.\n",

      "While Nedd4L shows a punctate staining pattern at the cell surface (see Figs 2C, 3B and 3C), it exhibited diffuse distribution throughout the cytoplasm (Fig 4A and B). In COS7 cells, co-expression of the FCHO2 BAR domain [amino acid (aa) 1-302] recruited Nedd4L to membrane tubules (Fig 4A). The Nedd4L C2 domain (Myc-Nedd4L C2, aa 1-160) was also concentrated to membrane tubules, whereas C2 domain-deleted Nedd4L (Myc-Nedd4L ÎC2) was not. In contrast to FCHO2, the FBP17 BAR domain did not recruit Nedd4L to membrane tubules. Additionally, the BAR domain protein amphiphysin1 did not recruit Nedd4L to membrane tubules. Thus, Nedd4L is selectively recruited through the C2 domain to membrane tubules generated by the FCHO2 BAR domain. Similar results were obtained in HEK293 cells (Fig 4B). In these cells, membrane tubules generated by amphiphysin1 were hardly detected. It showed a punctate staining pattern and did not co-localized with Nedd4L.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also investigated whether the FCHO2 BAR domain not only recruits but also activates Nedd4L in cells. For this purpose, we performed an in vivo ubiquitination assay using HEK293 cells, which formed membrane tubules upon FCHO2 expression more efficiently than did COS7 cells: 91 Â± 2% of HEK293 cells vs. 32 Â± 2% of COS7 cells [the mean Â± standard error of the mean (S.E.M.) of four independent experiments]. As the catalytic activity of E3 Ub ligases is typically reflected in their autoubiquitination (Wiesner et al, 2007), we determined activity by measuring the ubiquitination level of Nedd4L itself. Expression of the FCHO2 BAR domain in cells remarkably enhanced Nedd4L autoubiquitination, whereas FBP17 or amphiphysin1 did not (Fig 5A). Tubulation-deficient FCHO2 mutants (K146E+R152E and L136E) (Henne et al, 2010) did not enhance Nedd4L activity (Fig 5AâC and Fig EV3). A catalytically inactive Nedd4L mutant, C922A, which was recruited to FCHO2-generated membrane tubules, showed little enhancement of ubiquitination upon FCHO2 expression (Fig 5D and E), indicating that Nedd4L ubiquitination is self-induced. Using Î±ENaC as a substrate, we further confirmed that Nedd4L is activated upon FCHO2 expression in cells (Fig 5F).\n",

      "Preference of Nedd4L for FCHO2-generated membrane curvature\n",
      "\n",
      "The aforementioned results prompted us to investigate whether FCHO2 and Nedd4L interact through membrane tubules rather than through stereotyped proteinâprotein interactions. Membrane tubules generated by BAR domains in cells have specific diameters (curvatures) (Henne et al, 2007; Peter et al, 2004; Takano et al, 2008; Takei et al, 1999; Yin et al, 2009). Nedd4L may preferentially bind to the specific degree of membrane curvature generated by FCHO2. To investigate this possibility, we first examined the biochemical properties of Nedd4L. Using a co-sedimentation assay with liposomes containing various percentages of PS, we found that the C2 domain of Nedd4L is a Ca2+-dependent PS-binding domain (Fig 6A and B). Submicromolar Ca2+ concentrations, which are comparable to intracellular levels in unstimulated cells, were sufficient for the Nedd4L C2 domain to bind to PS-containing liposomes. The C2 domain alone and full-length Nedd4L showed different Ca2+ requirements. The higher Ca2+ requirement of full-length Nedd4L may be due to the intramolecular interaction between the C2 and HECT domains. Increasing PS percentages in synthetic liposomes enhanced the liposome binding of the Nedd4L C2 domain, and PS requirements varied depending on Ca2+ concentration.\n",
      "\n",
      "We next examined whether Nedd4L preferentially binds to a specific degree of membrane curvature. For this purpose, liposomes of different sizes (curvatures) were prepared by stepwise extrusion through filter membranes with different pore sizes (0.8, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, and 0.03 Âµm) and sonication. Sonication or extrusion through a 0.03 Âµm pore-size filter was used to prepare the smallest liposomes. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the actual liposome size was similar to the pore size for 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, and 0.03 Âµm pore-size liposomes, whereas it was significantly smaller for 0.8 and 0.4 Âµm pore-size liposomes (Fig 7A). Nedd4L showed the strongest binding to 0.05 Âµm pore-size liposomes (Fig 7B).\n",

      "Synaptotagmin I (SytI) tandem C2 domains can both generate and sense membrane curvature in vitro by penetrating their hydrophobic residues into the lipid bilayer (Martens et al, 2007). As a sensor, the binding affinity is considered to be highest for membranes that have a degree of curvature consistent with that generated by SytI itself. We investigated whether, in addition to sensing membrane curvature, the Nedd4L C2 domain can also generate membrane curvature in vitro and, if so, what diameter of membrane tubules is generated. As expected, transmission electron microscopy revealed that the C2 domain deformed liposomes into extensive tubulation (Fig 7C). It should be noted that Nedd4L does not generate membrane tubules in cells (see Fig 4A and B). The tubule diameter generated by Nedd4L in vitro was mainly 40â80 nm, which is consistent not only with the diameter of 0.05 Âµm pore-size liposomes, to which Nedd4L preferentially binds, but also with the diameter of membrane tubules generated by FCHO2 (Fig 7D). These results suggest that Nedd4L shows the highest binding affinity for the degree of membrane curvature generated by FCHO2. It is therefore likely that FCHO2-induced recruitment and activation of Nedd4L are mediated by the degree of membrane curvature.\n",

      "Roles of conserved hydrophobic residues in the Nedd4L C2 domain\n",
      "\n",
      "We compared the C2 domain sequence of Nedd4L to those of other Nedd4 family members, SytI, and PKCÎ³ (Fig 8A). SytI C2 domains possess hydrophobic residues (M173, F234, V304, and I367) for penetration into the lipid bilayer to generate and sense membrane curvature (Martens et al, 2007). The Nedd4L C2 domain also has three hydrophobic residues (I37, F38, and L99), which are conserved among Nedd4 family members except for WWP2. We mutated these residues to alanine to produce six mutants, I37A, F38A, L99A, I37A+F38A, I37A+L99A, and I37A+F38A+L99A (triple-A). Any single mutation did not inhibit Nedd4L recruitment to FCHO2-generated membrane tubules (Fig 8B). However, double and triple mutations severely impaired this recruitment. Furthermore, the I37A+F38A and triple-A mutants showed little liposome binding and lost curvature generation (Fig 8C and D). Thus, these hydrophobic residues (I37, F38, and L99) are critical for both membrane binding and curvature sensing and generation. These residues are likely inserted into the lipid bilayer, thereby strengthening the C2 domain interaction with membranes and enabling the sensing and generation of membrane curvature. It has been shown that I37 and F38 are directly involved in Ca2+ binding (Escobedo et al, 2014). The residues may be inserted into the lipid bilayer while binding Ca2+.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the C2 domain of Smurf2, another Nedd4 family member, conserved hydrophobic residues (F29 and F30) are responsible for interactions with the HECT domain (Fig 8A) (Wiesner et al, 2007). Mutation at these residues impairs the interaction between the C2 and HECT domains, resulting in enhanced Smurf2 autoubiquitination by relieving autoinhibition. Consistent with these previous findings, we found that the Nedd4L I37A+F38A mutant, which was not recruited to FCHO2-generated membrane tubules, enhanced autoubiquitination, irrespective of FCHO2 expression (Fig 5D and E). These results suggest that I37 and F38 are critical for interactions with the HECT domain as well as for membrane binding and curvature sensing. Interestingly, the Nedd4L I37A+F38A mutant, as well as the C922A mutant, showed little Î±ENaC ubiquitination (Fig EV4), indicating that membrane binding of Nedd4L is critical for ENaC ubiquitination.\n",

      "In vitro activation of Nedd4L by FCHO2-generated membrane curvature\n",
      "\n",
      "To examine the properties of Nedd4L catalytic activity, we carried out an in vitro ubiquitination assay using an Î±ENaC peptide as a substrate. The Î±ENaC peptide possesses a conserved PY motif for interaction with the Nedd4L WW domain, and it is fused with monomeric streptavidin (mSA) (Lim et al, 2013) to bind to liposomes containing biotinylated phospholipids (biotinylated liposomes) (Sakamoto et al, 2017) (Fig 9A and B). We found that Ca2+ and PS were required for Nedd4L catalytic activity (Fig 9C and D), and that 0.05 Âµm pore-size liposomes were most effective in stimulating Ca2+- and PS-dependent Nedd4L activity (Fig 9E). Thus, the properties of Nedd4L catalytic activity are similar to those of its liposome binding. Furthermore, we found that Nedd4L did not ubiquitinate PY motif-mutated (Y644A in Î±ENaC) mSA-Î±ENaC (Appendix Fig S3). These findings are consistent with defects in ENaC ubiquitination observed in Liddle syndrome.\n",
      "\n",
      "We next examined whether membrane localization of mSA-Î±ENaC affects the membrane binding and catalytic activity of Nedd4L. Nedd4L bound only slightly to mSA-Î±ENaC on PS-free (0% PS) liposomes, but the liposome binding was synergistically increased by elevating the PS percentage in liposomes (Fig 9F). By contrast, when free biotin competitively inhibited the binding of mSA-Î±ENaC to biotinylated liposomes, the PS-dependent liposome binding of Nedd4L was significantly reduced, resulting in remarkable inhibition of mSA-Î±ENaC ubiquitination (Fig 9D and F). Thus, membrane localization of the PY motif is critical for membrane binding and activation of Nedd4L. It is, therefore, likely that the PY motifs on membranes, such as ENaC, play a role in enhancing Nedd4L catalytic activity by potentiating membrane binding through interactions with the WW domain.\n",
      "\n",
      "We then reconstituted in vitro FCHO2-induced recruitment and activation of Nedd4L. When liposomes (20% PS) were used, the FCHO2 BAR domain enhanced the liposome binding of Nedd4L (Fig 10A) and mSA-Î±ENaC ubiquitination (Fig 10B). This enhancement was lost when the strength of interaction of Nedd4L with liposomes was increased by elevating the PS percentage in liposomes (~50% PS) (Fig 10C and Fig EV5).ãIn contrast to FCHO2, neither amphiphysin1 nor FBP17 enhanced Nedd4L activity (Fig 10D and Fig EV6A). Similarly, tubulation-deficient FCHO2 mutant (L136E) did not enhance Nedd4L activity (Fig 10E and Fig EV6A). These results are in good agreement with those obtained from in vivo experiments on FCHO2-induced recruitment and activation of Nedd4L. Electron microscopic analysis revealed that mSA-Î±ENaC-associated liposomes were deformed by membrane-sculpting proteins into tubules with diameters similar to those of mSA-Î±ENaC-free liposomes (Fig EV6B and see also Fig 7D). The diameter of membrane tubules generated by FCHO2 is consistent with that of 0.05 Âµm pore-size liposomes which are most effective in stimulating Nedd4L activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "To confirm whether FCHO2-induced recruitment and activation of Nedd4L are mediated by liposomes (i.e., membrane curvature) rather than by proteinâprotein interactions, we conducted two sets of experiments. Initially, we employed synthetic liposomes where 20% PS was substituted with 5% PI(4,5)P2. The FCHO2 BAR domain bound to PI(4,5)P2 as well as PS with high affinity, whereas the Nedd4L C2 domain did not (Fig 11A and B). The FCHO2 BAR domain is known to induce the tubulation of liposomes [5% PI(4,5)P2] (Henne et al, 2010). If Nedd4L could interact through proteinâprotein interactions with the FCHO2 BAR domain binding to liposomes [5% PI(4,5)P2], the BAR domain would facilitate the co-precipitation of Nedd4L in a co-sedimentation assay, thereby stimulating mSA-Î±ENaC ubiquitination. However, the FCHO2 BAR domain did not demonstrate such interactions (Fig 11C and D). Therefore, it is unlikely that Nedd4L interacts with the FCHO2 BAR domain on liposomes through proteinâprotein interactions. Secondly, we employed 0.05 Âµm pore-size liposomes that are most effective in stimulating Nedd4L activity. The diameter of 0.05 Âµm pore-size liposomes is consistent with that of membrane tubules generated by the FCHO2 BAR domain. The BAR domain is, thus, expected not to induce the tubulation of 0.05 Âµm pore-size liposomes. The FCHO2 BAR domain showed similar binding activity toward 0.8 and 0.05 Âµm pore-size liposomes (Fig 12A). When 0.8 Âµm pore-size liposomes were used, the FCHO2 BAR domain enhanced Nedd4L activity (Fig 12B). However, in the case of 0.05 Âµm pore-size liposomes, curvature-stimulated Nedd4L activity was not potentiated by the addition of the FCHO2 BAR domain. If Nedd4L had interacted with the BAR domain, we would have expected potentiation of Nedd4L activity. These results strongly suggest that FCHO2-induced activation of Nedd4L is mediated by membrane curvature and not by proteinâprotein interactions.\n",

      "Discussion\n",
      "\n",
      "Nedd4L represents the ancestral Ub ligase with strong similarity to yeast Rsp5 which plays a key role in the trafficking, sorting, and degradation of a large number of proteins (Yang & Kumar, 2010). Consistently, Nedd4L regulates a growing number of substrates, including membrane receptors, transporters, and ion channels. Although Nedd4L exists in a catalytically autoinhibited state due to an intramolecular interaction between the N-terminal C2 and C-terminal HECT domains, little is known about its activation mechanism. In this study, we clearly demonstrated that Nedd4L is activated by FCHO2 F-BAR domain-induced membrane curvature. It has been shown that the activity of synptojanin-1, a phosphoinositide phosphatase, is modulated by membrane curvature (Chang-Ileto et al, 2011). Taken together, it is conceivable that membrane curvature serves as a signal for the activation of various enzymes involved in membrane trafficking.\n",

      "Unique Properties of the Nedd4L C2 Domain\n",
      "\n",
      "Although both sytI and Nedd4L C2 domains are Ca2+-dependent PS-binding domains that can generate and sense membrane curvature, their properties show a number of significant differences. An interesting difference exists in the degrees of membrane curvatures generated by sytI and Nedd4L: the diameters of their membrane tubules are about 15â20 nm and 40â80 nm, respectively (Hui et al, 2009; Martens et al, 2007). This difference is not simply due to that between tandem and single C2 domains, because it has been shown that the sytI C2B domain alone generates membrane tubules with a similar diameter (Hui et al, 2009). SytI and Nedd4L C2 domains must therefore have respective unique structures that determine the specific degrees of membrane curvatures that they sense and generate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another important difference between sytI and Nedd4L C2 domains exists in their Ca2+ requirements. SytI C2 domains require Ca2+ concentrations in the submillimolar range to generate membrane curvature (Hui et al, 2009). In contrast, submicromolar Ca2+ concentrations, which are comparable to intracellular levels in unstimulated cells, are sufficient for the Nedd4L C2 domain to sense membrane curvature. This is consistent with the observation that Nedd4L is recruited and activated in serum-starved cells. The different Ca2+ requirements between sytI and Nedd4L C2 domains are reflected in their functions. SytI C2 domains induce membrane curvature in response to an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, which is essential for Ca2+-triggered membrane fusion (Hui et al, 2009; Martens et al, 2007). Thus, sytI C2 domains serve as a Ca2+ sensor and a curvature generator. In contrast, the Nedd4L C2 domain recognizes a specific degree of curvature without an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Therefore, the Nedd4L C2 domain serves as a curvature sensor to regulate the localization and activity of the E3 Ub ligase.\n",
      "\n",
      "A striking feature that distinguishes the Nedd4L C2 domain from other C2 domain proteins (except for at least a subset of Nedd4 family members) is that the Nedd4L C2 domain interacts not only with membranes but also with the intramolecular catalytic domain for its autoinhibition. Mutational experiments have revealed that I37 and F38 residues in the C2 domain are critical for interactions with both membranes and the HECT domain, suggesting that these two interactions are competitive. This idea is supported by the observation that the Ca2+ EC50 value of full-length Nedd4L is much higher than that of the C2 domain. The HECT domain in full-length Nedd4L may competitively inhibit the interaction of the C2 domain with membranes. It is likely that membranes displace the HECT domain from the C2 domain when the strength of the C2 domain interaction with membranes is increased by the preferred membrane curvature. This displacement relieves the autoinhibition, resulting in Nedd4L activation. Thus, the membrane binding of Nedd4L is coupled with its activation.\n",

      "Stimulatory and inhibitory effects of the FCHO2 BAR domain on the liposome binding and catalytic activity of Nedd4L\n",
      "\n",
      "The FCHO2 BAR domain enhances both the liposome binding and catalytic activity of Nedd4L when the interaction strength of Nedd4L with liposomes is weak (20% PS) (Fig 10A and B). Conversely, the BAR domain inhibits the binding and activity of Nedd4L when the interaction of Nedd4L with liposomes is increased by elevating the PS percentage in liposomes (~50% PS) (Fig 10C and Fig EV5). Thus, the FCHO2 BAR domain exerts both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on Nedd4L, depending on the PS percentage in liposomes. However, given that 20% PS is comparable to the concentration in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, it is plausible that FCHO2 exhibits only a stimulatory effect on Nedd4L in cells. The mechanism underlying the stimulatory and inhibitory effects in vitro is as follows: when using liposomes (20% PS), Nedd4L hardly binds to liposomes through PS (Fig. 9F and 10A). The addition of the FCHO2 BAR domain enhances the strength of Nedd4Lâs interaction with PS by inducing membrane curvature. Consequently, Nedd4L gains a new binding to liposomes through PS, which augments its catalytic activity. In contrast, when using liposomes (~50% PS), Nedd4L binds to liposome through PS. The addition of the FCHO2 BAR domain hinders the PS-mediated liposome binding of Nedd4L, because FCHO2 and Nedd4L are PS-binding proteins and compete for PS binding in liposomes. Consequently, the BAR domain inhibits the catalytic activity of Nedd4L. This is consistent with the results obtained with 0.05 Âµm pore-size liposomes (Fig 12B). These 0.05 Âµm pore-size liposomes are comparable to liposomes with a higher PS percentage, as the interaction of Nedd4L with liposomes through PS is increased by membrane curvature. Therefore, when using 0.05 Âµm pore-size liposomes, the FCHO2 BAR domain inhibits the catalytic activity of Nedd4L.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on a model in which a subset of BAR domain proteins, such as FCHO2 and FBP17, drive liposome tubulation in vitro (Frost et al, 2008; Shimada et al, 2007), the FCHO2 BAR domain is considered to polymerize on the liposome surface into spiral dense coats by lateral and tip-to-tip interactions. When using liposomes (~50% PS), it is conceivable that the FCHO2 BAR domain densely packs the liposomes, leaving little free space for Nedd4L binding. Conversely, when using liposomes (20% PS), it is likely that the liposomes are loosely packed, providing ample surface space for Nedd4L binding.\n",

      "Model for ENaC Endocytosis\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the present study, we propose a model for ENaC endocytosis through ubiquitination (Fig 13). First, FCHO2 binds to the plasma membrane and generates a specific degree of membrane curvature. FCHO2 interacts with clathrin adaptor proteins, such as Eps15, and recruits the clathrin machinery for CCP formation (Uezu et al, 2011; Henne et al, 2010). Eps15 has Ub-interacting motifs (Di Fiore et al, 2003). Nedd4L is subsequently recruited to and activated by FCHO2-generated curved membrane at the rim of nascent CCPs that ENaC enters. ENaC is then ubiquitinated and captured by Eps15 which FCHO2 interacts with. Thus, ubiquitinated ENaC is spatially restricted to CCPs and separated from unmodified ENaC. Overall, our findings suggest that in the early stage of CME, a membrane deformation induced by FCHO2 can program, through both the recruitment and activation of Nedd4L, the gathering of a subclass of cargo molecules in CCPs.\n",

His6-tagged proteins were purified with Talon metal affinity resin (Clontech) using the manufacturerâs protocol. The GST tag was cleaved off by PreScission protease (GE Healthcare). The GST tag of BAR domains did not inhibit liposome binding or tubulation, whereas the GST tag of Nedd4L inhibited these functions. As FCHO2 (BAR domain, aa 1â302) was easily aggregated by the removal of the GST tag, FCHO2 (aa 1â327) was used instead as a GST-cleaved form of the FCHO2 BAR domain.

      "<p>The C2-WW-HECT domain ubiquitin ligase Nedd4L regulates membrane sorting during endocytosis through the ubiquitination of cargo molecules such as the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). Nedd4L is catalytically autoinhibited by an intramolecular interaction between its C2 and HECT domains, but the proteinâs activation mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we show that Nedd4L activation is linked to membrane shape by FCHO2, a Bin-Amphiphysin-Rsv (BAR) domain protein that regulates endocytosis. FCHO2 was required for the Nedd4L-mediated ubiquitination and endocytosis of ENaC, with Nedd4L co-localizing with FCHO2 at clathrin-coated pits. In cells, Nedd4L was specifically recruited to, and activated by, the FCHO2 BAR domain. Furthermore, we reconstituted FCHO2-induced recruitment and activation of Nedd4L in vitro. Both the recruitment and activation were mediated by membrane curvature rather than protein-protein interactions. The Nedd4L C2 domain recognized a specific degree of membrane curvature that was generated by the FCHO2 BAR domain, with this curvature directly activating Nedd4L by relieving its autoinhibition. Thus, we show for the first time a specific function (i.e., recruitment and activation of an enzyme regulating cargo sorting) of membrane curvature by a BAR domain protein.</p>\n",

      "<p>Introduction</p>\n",
      "<p></p>\n",
      "<p>Posttranslational modification of proteins by covalent attachment of ubiquitin (Ub) is catalyzed by three enzymes: a Ub-activating enzyme (E1), a Ub-conjugating enzyme (E2), and a Ub-protein ligase (E3) that determines substrate specificity (Hershko & Ciechanover, 1998). E3 Ub ligases are classified into two categories based on their Ub transfer mechanisms: RING finger/U-box E3 and HECT-type E3. The Nedd4 family belongs to HECT-type E3 Ub ligases and consists of nine members, including Nedd4/Nedd4-1, Nedd4L/Nedd4-2, Itch, Smurf1, Smurf2, WWP1, WWP2, NEDL1, and NEDL2 (Ingham et al, 2004; Rotin & Kumar, 2009). They are characterized by a common modular organization, with an N-terminal C2 domain, two to four WW domains, and a C-terminal catalytic HECT domain. While the C2 domain was originally identified in protein kinase C (PKC) as a Ca2+-dependent phosphatidylserine (PS)-binding domain (Nishizuka, 1992), it shows significant diversity in the binding partners, including intracellular proteins and other phospholipids, such as phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] (Lemmon, 2008). The WW domains recognize proline-rich motifs, such as PPxY (PY motif, where x is any residue), of substrates or adaptor proteins. The HECT domain catalyzes the isopeptide bond formation between the Ub C terminus and the substrate lysine residues. At least some of the Nedd4 family members, including Nedd4L, are catalytically autoinhibited by an intramolecular interaction between the C2 and HECT domains (Wang et al, 2010; Wiesner et al, 2007; Zhu et al, 2017). However, the activation mechanism of the Nedd4 family is poorly understood.</p>\n",
      "<p>The Nedd4 family is implicated in a wide variety of cellular processes by regulating membrane trafficking and degradation of components of various signaling pathways (Ingham et al, 2004; Rotin & Kumar, 2009). Among a diversity of substrates, the best-characterized is the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). This channel is composed of three subunits, Î±-, Î²-, and Î³ENaC, each of which possesses two transmembrane segments and intracellular N- and C-termini with a large extracellular loop (Butterworth, 2010; Rotin & Staub, 2011; Rossier, 2014). Each subunit has a PY motif at the cytosolic C-terminus. Nedd4L Ub ligase specifically binds to the PY motif and mediates the ubiquitination of lysine residues on the N-terminus of at least Î±- and Î³ENaC at the plasma membrane. Ub serves as an internalization signal for recognition by adaptor proteins, such as epsin and Eps15, for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) (Traub, 2009). Consequently, ENaC is constitutively internalized through CME. Heterozygous mutations of the PY motif of Î²- or Î³ENaC lead to impaired ubiquitination and endocytosis, resulting in persistence of the channels at the cell surface and increased Na+ absorption in Liddle syndrome, an autosomal dominant form of severe hypertension.</p>\n",
      "<p>The process of CME begins at the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane with the assembly of clathrin with adaptor proteins and transmembrane cargo molecules (Doherty & McMahon, 2009; Traub, 2009). In parallel with this assembly, membrane curvature is generated to form hemispherical clathrin-coated pits (CCPs). This process leads to deep membrane invaginations. Subsequently, the neck of invaginated pits is constricted and severed to separate the newly formed clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) from the plasma membrane. These membrane curvatures are considered to be generated, sensed, and/or maintained by Bin-Amphiphysin-Rsv (BAR) domain superfamily proteins. BAR domains form a crescent-shaped dimer characterized by a specific degree of intrinsic curvature. They bind to negatively charged phospholipids, such as PS, and force membranes to bend according to their intrinsic curvatures, thereby inducing the formation of membrane tubules with specific diameters (curvatures). For example, the diameters of membrane tubules generated by the amphiphysin BAR domain, FCHO2 BAR domain, and FBP17 BAR domain are 20â50 nm (sharper curvature) (Peter et al, 2004; Takei et al, 1999; Yin et al, 2009), 50â80 nm (intermediate curvature) (Henne et al, 2007), and ~150 nm (Takano et al, 2008) (shallower curvature), respectively.</p>\n",
      "<p>The FCHO2 BAR domain has been proposed to trigger the initial invagination for CCP formation (Henne et al, 2010). FCHO2 binds to the flat surface of the plasma membrane at sites where CCPs will form. FCHO2 then generates the initial membrane curvature and recruits the clathrin machinery for CCP formation. Here, we report the role of FCHO2 in Nedd4L-mediated ENaC endocytosis and show that FCHO2 BAR domain-generated membrane curvature induces the recruitment and activation of Nedd4L.</p>\n",

      "<p></p>\n",
      "<p>FCHO2 is required for Nedd4L-mediated ubiquitination and endocytosis of ENaC</p>\n",
      "<p>To study the role of FCHO2 in ENaC endocytosis, we established a HeLa cell line stably expressing all three subunits, Î±-, Î²-, and Î³ENaC (Î±Î²Î³ENaC-HeLa cells) (Fig EV1A-C). A FLAG tag was introduced into the extracellular region of Î±ENaC in a position previously shown not to affect channel activity (Firsov et al, 1996). Upon FCHO2 knockdown by small interfering RNA (siRNA) methods, ENaC internalization was reduced, as was upon Nedd4L knockdown (Zhou et al, 2007) (Fig 1 A and B). Transferrin receptor (TfR) internalization was reduced upon FCHO2 knockdown but not upon Nedd4L knockdown (Fig 1C). The phenotype of FCHO2 knockdown in ENaC internalization was rescued by an siRNA-resistant (sr) form of FCHO2 (Fig 1D and Appendix Fig S1). Furthermore, Î±ENaC ubiquitination was reduced upon FCHO2 or Nedd4L knockdown but not upon FBP17 knockdown (Fig 1E and Fig EV2). FCHO2 or Nedd4L knockdown increased Î±ENaC expression at the cell surface (Fig 1E and F). These results suggest that FCHO2 is required for Nedd4L-mediated ubiquitination and endocytosis of ENaC.</p>\n",
      "<p></p>\n",
      "<p>Recruitment and activation of Nedd4L by FCHO2 in cells</p>\n",
      "<p>Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that in Î±Î²Î³ENaC-HeLa cells, cell-surface Î±ENaC co-localized with FCHO2 at clathrin-coated structures (Fig 2A). However, its co-localization with Nedd4L was not detected (Appendix Fig S2A), because exogenous expression of Nedd4L-green fluorescent protein (GFP) stimulated ENaC internalization, resulting in the disappearance of Î±ENaC from the cell surface. Cell-surface Î±ENaC was observed in cells lacking Nedd4L-GFP expression (non-transfected cells). When a catalytically inactive Nedd4L mutant, C922A, was expressed, it co-localized with cell-surface Î±ENaC and endogenous FCHO2 (Fig 2B). The mutant also formed FCHO2-negative spots. In wild-type HeLa cells, Nedd4L accumulated at clathrin-coated structures where FCHO2 localized (Fig 2C). Additionally, Nedd4L formed clathrin-negative spots, suggesting that they may be involved in clathrin-independent endocytosis.</p>\n",
      "<p>Using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, we investigated whether Nedd4L is recruited to CCPs in wild-type HeLa cells. Similar to FCHO2 described previously (Henne et al, 2010; Lehmann et al, 2019; Zaccai et al, 2022), Nedd4L showed dynamic co-localization with clathrin during pit formation (Fig 3). When both fluorescent protein-tagged FCHO2 and Nedd4L were expressed, the accumulation of Nedd4L at FCHO2-positive spots was not clearly observed (Appendix Fig S2B). The reason behind this remains unknown, but it has been shown that clathrin coat formation, measured in time-lapse images of cells expressing fluorescent proteins, is affected by several factors, such as overexpression level, choice of the proteins, and choice of the fluorescent tag (Aguet et al, 2013). These factors may contribute to the failure to detect the accumulation of Nedd4L at FCHO2-positive spots.</p>\n",
      "<p>While Nedd4L shows a punctate staining pattern at the cell surface (see Figs 2C, 3B and 3C), it exhibited diffuse distribution throughout the cytoplasm (Fig 4A and B). In COS7 cells, co-expression of the FCHO2 BAR domain [amino acid (aa) 1-302] recruited Nedd4L to membrane tubules (Fig 4A). The Nedd4L C2 domain (Myc-Nedd4L C2, aa 1-160) was also concentrated to membrane tubules, whereas C2 domain-deleted Nedd4L (Myc-Nedd4L ÎC2) was not. In contrast to FCHO2, the FBP17 BAR domain did not recruit Nedd4L to membrane tubules. Additionally, the BAR domain protein amphiphysin1 did not recruit Nedd4L to membrane tubules. Thus, Nedd4L is selectively recruited through the C2 domain to membrane tubules generated by the FCHO2 BAR domain. Similar results were obtained in HEK293 cells (Fig 4B). In these cells, membrane tubules generated by amphiphysin1 were hardly detected. It showed a punctate staining pattern and did not co-localized with Nedd4L.</p>\n",
      "<p>We also investigated whether the FCHO2 BAR domain not only recruits but also activates Nedd4L in cells. For this purpose, we performed an in vivo ubiquitination assay using HEK293 cells, which formed membrane tubules upon FCHO2 expression more efficiently than did COS7 cells: 91 Â± 2% of HEK293 cells vs. 32 Â± 2% of COS7 cells [the mean Â± standard error of the mean (S.E.M.) of four independent experiments]. As the catalytic activity of E3 Ub ligases is typically reflected in their autoubiquitination (Wiesner et al, 2007), we determined activity by measuring the ubiquitination level of Nedd4L itself. Expression of the FCHO2 BAR domain in cells remarkably enhanced Nedd4L autoubiquitination, whereas FBP17 or amphiphysin1 did not (Fig 5A). Tubulation-deficient FCHO2 mutants (K146E+R152E and L136E) (Henne et al, 2010) did not enhance Nedd4L activity (Fig 5AâC and Fig EV3). A catalytically inactive Nedd4L mutant, C922A, which was recruited to FCHO2-generated membrane tubules, showed little enhancement of ubiquitination upon FCHO2 expression (Fig 5D and E), indicating that Nedd4L ubiquitination is self-induced. Using Î±ENaC as a substrate, we further confirmed that Nedd4L is activated upon FCHO2 expression in cells (Fig 5F).</p>\n",
      "<p></p>\n",
      "<p>Preference of Nedd4L for FCHO2-generated membrane curvature</p>\n",
      "<p>The aforementioned results prompted us to investigate whether FCHO2 and Nedd4L interact through membrane tubules rather than through stereotyped proteinâprotein interactions. Membrane tubules generated by BAR domains in cells have specific diameters (curvatures) (Henne et al, 2007; Peter et al, 2004; Takano et al, 2008; Takei et al, 1999; Yin et al, 2009). Nedd4L may preferentially bind to the specific degree of membrane curvature generated by FCHO2. To investigate this possibility, we first examined the biochemical properties of Nedd4L. Using a co-sedimentation assay with liposomes containing various percentages of PS, we found that the C2 domain of Nedd4L is a Ca2+-dependent PS-binding domain (Fig 6A and B). Submicromolar Ca2+ concentrations, which are comparable to intracellular levels in unstimulated cells, were sufficient for the Nedd4L C2 domain to bind to PS-containing liposomes. The C2 domain alone and full-length Nedd4L showed different Ca2+ requirements. The higher Ca2+ requirement of full-length Nedd4L may be due to the intramolecular interaction between the C2 and HECT domains. Increasing PS percentages in synthetic liposomes enhanced the liposome binding of the Nedd4L C2 domain, and PS requirements varied depending on Ca2+ concentration.</p>\n",
      "<p>We next examined whether Nedd4L preferentially binds to a specific degree of membrane curvature. For this purpose, liposomes of different sizes (curvatures) were prepared by stepwise extrusion through filter membranes with different pore sizes (0.8, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, and 0.03 Âµm) and sonication. Sonication or extrusion through a 0.03 Âµm pore-size filter was used to prepare the smallest liposomes. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the actual liposome size was similar to the pore size for 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, and 0.03 Âµm pore-size liposomes, whereas it was significantly smaller for 0.8 and 0.4 Âµm pore-size liposomes (Fig 7A). Nedd4L showed the strongest binding to 0.05 Âµm pore-size liposomes (Fig 7B).</p>\n",
      "<p>Synaptotagmin I (SytI) tandem C2 domains can both generate and sense membrane curvature in vitro by penetrating their hydrophobic residues into the lipid bilayer (Martens et al, 2007). As a sensor, the binding affinity is considered to be highest for membranes that have a degree of curvature consistent with that generated by SytI itself. We investigated whether, in addition to sensing membrane curvature, the Nedd4L C2 domain can also generate membrane curvature in vitro and, if so, what diameter of membrane tubules is generated. As expected, transmission electron microscopy revealed that the C2 domain deformed liposomes into extensive tubulation (Fig 7C). It should be noted that Nedd4L does not generate membrane tubules in cells (see Fig 4A and B). The tubule diameter generated by Nedd4L in vitro was mainly 40â80 nm, which is consistent not only with the diameter of 0.05 Âµm pore-size liposomes, to which Nedd4L preferentially binds, but also with the diameter of membrane tubules generated by FCHO2 (Fig 7D). These results suggest that Nedd4L shows the highest binding affinity for the degree of membrane curvature generated by FCHO2. It is therefore likely that FCHO2-induced recruitment and activation of Nedd4L are mediated by the degree of membrane curvature.</p>\n",

      "<p>Roles of conserved hydrophobic residues in the Nedd4L C2 domain</p>\n",
      "<p>We compared the C2 domain sequence of Nedd4L to those of other Nedd4 family members, SytI, and PKCÎ³ (Fig 8A). SytI C2 domains possess hydrophobic residues (M173, F234, V304, and I367) for penetration into the lipid bilayer to generate and sense membrane curvature (Martens et al, 2007). The Nedd4L C2 domain also has three hydrophobic residues (I37, F38, and L99), which are conserved among Nedd4 family members except for WWP2. We mutated these residues to alanine to produce six mutants, I37A, F38A, L99A, I37A+F38A, I37A+L99A, and I37A+F38A+L99A (triple-A). Any single mutation did not inhibit Nedd4L recruitment to FCHO2-generated membrane tubules (Fig 8B). However, double and triple mutations severely impaired this recruitment. Furthermore, the I37A+F38A and triple-A mutants showed little liposome binding and lost curvature generation (Fig 8C and D). Thus, these hydrophobic residues (I37, F38, and L99) are critical for both membrane binding and curvature sensing and generation. These residues are likely inserted into the lipid bilayer, thereby strengthening the C2 domain interaction with membranes and enabling the sensing and generation of membrane curvature. It has been shown that I37 and F38 are directly involved in Ca2+ binding (Escobedo et al, 2014). The residues may be inserted into the lipid bilayer while binding Ca2+.</p>\n",
      "<p>In the C2 domain of Smurf2, another Nedd4 family member, conserved hydrophobic residues (F29 and F30) are responsible for interactions with the HECT domain (Fig 8A) (Wiesner et al, 2007). Mutation at these residues impairs the interaction between the C2 and HECT domains, resulting in enhanced Smurf2 autoubiquitination by relieving autoinhibition. Consistent with these previous findings, we found that the Nedd4L I37A+F38A mutant, which was not recruited to FCHO2-generated membrane tubules, enhanced autoubiquitination, irrespective of FCHO2 expression (Fig 5D and E). These results suggest that I37 and F38 are critical for interactions with the HECT domain as well as for membrane binding and curvature sensing. Interestingly, the Nedd4L I37A+F38A mutant, as well as the C922A mutant, showed little Î±ENaC ubiquitination (Fig EV4), indicating that membrane binding of Nedd4L is critical for ENaC ubiquitination.</p>\n",
      "<p></p>\n",
      "<p>In vitro activation of Nedd4L by FCHO2-generated membrane curvature</p>\n",
      "<p>To examine the properties of Nedd4L catalytic activity, we carried out an in vitro ubiquitination assay using an Î±ENaC peptide as a substrate. The Î±ENaC peptide possesses a conserved PY motif for interaction with the Nedd4L WW domain, and it is fused with monomeric streptavidin (mSA) (Lim et al, 2013) to bind to liposomes containing biotinylated phospholipids (biotinylated liposomes) (Sakamoto et al, 2017) (Fig 9A and B). We found that Ca2+ and PS were required for Nedd4L catalytic activity (Fig 9C and D), and that 0.05 Âµm pore-size liposomes were most effective in stimulating Ca2+- and PS-dependent Nedd4L activity (Fig 9E). Thus, the properties of Nedd4L catalytic activity are similar to those of its liposome binding. Furthermore, we found that Nedd4L did not ubiquitinate PY motif-mutated (Y644A in Î±ENaC) mSA-Î±ENaC (Appendix Fig S3). These findings are consistent with defects in ENaC ubiquitination observed in Liddle syndrome.</p>\n",
      "<p>We next examined whether membrane localization of mSA-Î±ENaC affects the membrane binding and catalytic activity of Nedd4L. Nedd4L bound only slightly to mSA-Î±ENaC on PS-free (0% PS) liposomes, but the liposome binding was synergistically increased by elevating the PS percentage in liposomes (Fig 9F). By contrast, when free biotin competitively inhibited the binding of mSA-Î±ENaC to biotinylated liposomes, the PS-dependent liposome binding of Nedd4L was significantly reduced, resulting in remarkable inhibition of mSA-Î±ENaC ubiquitination (Fig 9D and F). Thus, membrane localization of the PY motif is critical for membrane binding and activation of Nedd4L. It is, therefore, likely that the PY motifs on membranes, such as ENaC, play a role in enhancing Nedd4L catalytic activity by potentiating membrane binding through interactions with the WW domain.</p>\n",
      "<p>We then reconstituted in vitro FCHO2-induced recruitment and activation of Nedd4L. When liposomes (20% PS) were used, the FCHO2 BAR domain enhanced the liposome binding of Nedd4L (Fig 10A) and mSA-Î±ENaC ubiquitination (Fig 10B). This enhancement was lost when the strength of interaction of Nedd4L with liposomes was increased by elevating the PS percentage in liposomes (~50% PS) (Fig 10C and Fig EV5).ãIn contrast to FCHO2, neither amphiphysin1 nor FBP17 enhanced Nedd4L activity (Fig 10D and Fig EV6A). Similarly, tubulation-deficient FCHO2 mutant (L136E) did not enhance Nedd4L activity (Fig 10E and Fig EV6A). These results are in good agreement with those obtained from in vivo experiments on FCHO2-induced recruitment and activation of Nedd4L. Electron microscopic analysis revealed that mSA-Î±ENaC-associated liposomes were deformed by membrane-sculpting proteins into tubules with diameters similar to those of mSA-Î±ENaC-free liposomes (Fig EV6B and see also Fig 7D). The diameter of membrane tubules generated by FCHO2 is consistent with that of 0.05 Âµm pore-size liposomes which are most effective in stimulating Nedd4L activity.</p>\n",
      "<p>To confirm whether FCHO2-induced recruitment and activation of Nedd4L are mediated by liposomes (i.e., membrane curvature) rather than by proteinâprotein interactions, we conducted two sets of experiments. Initially, we employed synthetic liposomes where 20% PS was substituted with 5% PI(4,5)P2. The FCHO2 BAR domain bound to PI(4,5)P2 as well as PS with high affinity, whereas the Nedd4L C2 domain did not (Fig 11A and B). The FCHO2 BAR domain is known to induce the tubulation of liposomes [5% PI(4,5)P2] (Henne et al, 2010). If Nedd4L could interact through proteinâprotein interactions with the FCHO2 BAR domain binding to liposomes [5% PI(4,5)P2], the BAR domain would facilitate the co-precipitation of Nedd4L in a co-sedimentation assay, thereby stimulating mSA-Î±ENaC ubiquitination. However, the FCHO2 BAR domain did not demonstrate such interactions (Fig 11C and D). Therefore, it is unlikely that Nedd4L interacts with the FCHO2 BAR domain on liposomes through proteinâprotein interactions. Secondly, we employed 0.05 Âµm pore-size liposomes that are most effective in stimulating Nedd4L activity. The diameter of 0.05 Âµm pore-size liposomes is consistent with that of membrane tubules generated by the FCHO2 BAR domain. The BAR domain is, thus, expected not to induce the tubulation of 0.05 Âµm pore-size liposomes. The FCHO2 BAR domain showed similar binding activity toward 0.8 and 0.05 Âµm pore-size liposomes (Fig 12A). When 0.8 Âµm pore-size liposomes were used, the FCHO2 BAR domain enhanced Nedd4L activity (Fig 12B). However, in the case of 0.05 Âµm pore-size liposomes, curvature-stimulated Nedd4L activity was not potentiated by the addition of the FCHO2 BAR domain. If Nedd4L had interacted with the BAR domain, we would have expected potentiation of Nedd4L activity. These results strongly suggest that FCHO2-induced activation of Nedd4L is mediated by membrane curvature and not by proteinâprotein interactions.</p>\n",
      "<p></p>\n",
      "<p>Discussion</p>\n",
      "<p></p>\n",
      "<p>Nedd4L represents the ancestral Ub ligase with strong similarity to yeast Rsp5 which plays a key role in the trafficking, sorting, and degradation of a large number of proteins (Yang & Kumar, 2010). Consistently, Nedd4L regulates a growing number of substrates, including membrane receptors, transporters, and ion channels. Although Nedd4L exists in a catalytically autoinhibited state due to an intramolecular interaction between the N-terminal C2 and C-terminal HECT domains, little is known about its activation mechanism. In this study, we clearly demonstrated that Nedd4L is activated by FCHO2 F-BAR domain-induced membrane curvature. It has been shown that the activity of synptojanin-1, a phosphoinositide phosphatase, is modulated by membrane curvature (Chang-Ileto et al, 2011). Taken together, it is conceivable that membrane curvature serves as a signal for the activation of various enzymes involved in membrane trafficking.</p>\n",
      "<p></p>\n",
      "<p>Unique Properties of the Nedd4L C2 Domain</p>\n",
      "<p>Although both sytI and Nedd4L C2 domains are Ca2+-dependent PS-binding domains that can generate and sense membrane curvature, their properties show a number of significant differences. An interesting difference exists in the degrees of membrane curvatures generated by sytI and Nedd4L: the diameters of their membrane tubules are about 15â20 nm and 40â80 nm, respectively (Hui et al, 2009; Martens et al, 2007). This difference is not simply due to that between tandem and single C2 domains, because it has been shown that the sytI C2B domain alone generates membrane tubules with a similar diameter (Hui et al, 2009). SytI and Nedd4L C2 domains must therefore have respective unique structures that determine the specific degrees of membrane curvatures that they sense and generate.</p>\n",
      "<p>Another important difference between sytI and Nedd4L C2 domains exists in their Ca2+ requirements. SytI C2 domains require Ca2+ concentrations in the submillimolar range to generate membrane curvature (Hui et al, 2009). In contrast, submicromolar Ca2+ concentrations, which are comparable to intracellular levels in unstimulated cells, are sufficient for the Nedd4L C2 domain to sense membrane curvature. This is consistent with the observation that Nedd4L is recruited and activated in serum-starved cells. The different Ca2+ requirements between sytI and Nedd4L C2 domains are reflected in their functions. SytI C2 domains induce membrane curvature in response to an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, which is essential for Ca2+-triggered membrane fusion (Hui et al, 2009; Martens et al, 2007). Thus, sytI C2 domains serve as a Ca2+ sensor and a curvature generator. In contrast, the Nedd4L C2 domain recognizes a specific degree of curvature without an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Therefore, the Nedd4L C2 domain serves as a curvature sensor to regulate the localization and activity of the E3 Ub ligase.</p>\n",
      "<p>A striking feature that distinguishes the Nedd4L C2 domain from other C2 domain proteins (except for at least a subset of Nedd4 family members) is that the Nedd4L C2 domain interacts not only with membranes but also with the intramolecular catalytic domain for its autoinhibition. Mutational experiments have revealed that I37 and F38 residues in the C2 domain are critical for interactions with both membranes and the HECT domain, suggesting that these two interactions are competitive. This idea is supported by the observation that the Ca2+ EC50 value of full-length Nedd4L is much higher than that of the C2 domain. The HECT domain in full-length Nedd4L may competitively inhibit the interaction of the C2 domain with membranes. It is likely that membranes displace the HECT domain from the C2 domain when the strength of the C2 domain interaction with membranes is increased by the preferred membrane curvature. This displacement relieves the autoinhibition, resulting in Nedd4L activation. Thus, the membrane binding of Nedd4L is coupled with its activation.</p>\n",
      "<p></p>\n",
      "<p>Stimulatory and inhibitory effects of the FCHO2 BAR domain on the liposome binding and catalytic activity of Nedd4L</p>\n",
      "<p>The FCHO2 BAR domain enhances both the liposome binding and catalytic activity of Nedd4L when the interaction strength of Nedd4L with liposomes is weak (20% PS) (Fig 10A and B). Conversely, the BAR domain inhibits the binding and activity of Nedd4L when the interaction of Nedd4L with liposomes is increased by elevating the PS percentage in liposomes (~50% PS) (Fig 10C and Fig EV5). Thus, the FCHO2 BAR domain exerts both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on Nedd4L, depending on the PS percentage in liposomes. However, given that 20% PS is comparable to the concentration in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, it is plausible that FCHO2 exhibits only a stimulatory effect on Nedd4L in cells. The mechanism underlying the stimulatory and inhibitory effects in vitro is as follows: when using liposomes (20% PS), Nedd4L hardly binds to liposomes through PS (Fig. 9F and 10A). The addition of the FCHO2 BAR domain enhances the strength of Nedd4Lâs interaction with PS by inducing membrane curvature. Consequently, Nedd4L gains a new binding to liposomes through PS, which augments its catalytic activity. In contrast, when using liposomes (~50% PS), Nedd4L binds to liposome through PS. The addition of the FCHO2 BAR domain hinders the PS-mediated liposome binding of Nedd4L, because FCHO2 and Nedd4L are PS-binding proteins and compete for PS binding in liposomes. Consequently, the BAR domain inhibits the catalytic activity of Nedd4L. This is consistent with the results obtained with 0.05 Âµm pore-size liposomes (Fig 12B). These 0.05 Âµm pore-size liposomes are comparable to liposomes with a higher PS percentage, as the interaction of Nedd4L with liposomes through PS is increased by membrane curvature. Therefore, when using 0.05 Âµm pore-size liposomes, the FCHO2 BAR domain inhibits the catalytic activity of Nedd4L.</p>\n",
      "<p>Based on a model in which a subset of BAR domain proteins, such as FCHO2 and FBP17, drive liposome tubulation in vitro (Frost et al, 2008; Shimada et al, 2007), the FCHO2 BAR domain is considered to polymerize on the liposome surface into spiral dense coats by lateral and tip-to-tip interactions. When using liposomes (~50% PS), it is conceivable that the FCHO2 BAR domain densely packs the liposomes, leaving little free space for Nedd4L binding. Conversely, when using liposomes (20% PS), it is likely that the liposomes are loosely packed, providing ample surface space for Nedd4L binding.</p>\n",
      "<p></p>\n",
      "<p>Model for ENaC Endocytosis</p>\n",
      "<p>Based on the present study, we propose a model for ENaC endocytosis through ubiquitination (Fig 13). First, FCHO2 binds to the plasma membrane and generates a specific degree of membrane curvature. FCHO2 interacts with clathrin adaptor proteins, such as Eps15, and recruits the clathrin machinery for CCP formation (Uezu et al, 2011; Henne et al, 2010). Eps15 has Ub-interacting motifs (Di Fiore et al, 2003). Nedd4L is subsequently recruited to and activated by FCHO2-generated curved membrane at the rim of nascent CCPs that ENaC enters. ENaC is then ubiquitinated and captured by Eps15 which FCHO2 interacts with. Thus, ubiquitinated ENaC is spatially restricted to CCPs and separated from unmodified ENaC. Overall, our findings suggest that in the early stage of CME, a membrane deformation induced by FCHO2 can program, through both the recruitment and activation of Nedd4L, the gathering of a subclass of cargo molecules in CCPs.</p>\n",

His6-tagged proteins were purified with Talon metal affinity resin (Clontech) using the manufacturerâs protocol. The GST tag was cleaved off by PreScission protease (GE Healthcare). The GST tag of BAR domains did not inhibit liposome binding or tubulation, whereas the GST tag of Nedd4L inhibited these functions. As FCHO2 (BAR domain, aa 1â302) was easily aggregated by the removal of the GST tag, FCHO2 (aa 1â327) was used instead as a GST-cleaved form of the FCHO2 BAR domain.

      "<p>Î±Î²Î³ENaC-HeLa cells at approximately 90% confluence in a 10-cm dish were starved with serum-free medium (DMEM containing 1% BSA, 1 Âµg/ml Dox, and 40 ÂµM amiloride) at 37Â°C for 4 h. For ENaC endocytosis, cells were then incubated with 5 Âµg/ml anti-FLAG M2 in 2 ml of DMEM containing 1% BSA at 4Â°C for 1 h to prevent internalization. After three washes with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mM MgCl2 and 0.1 mM CaCl2 (PBS-CM), endocytosis was allowed by incubating cells in prewarmed DMEM containing 1% BSA at 37Â°C for the indicated periods of time. Endocytosis was stopped by placing cells on ice and washing them with ice-cold PBS-CM. Antibody bound to the cell surface but not internalized was removed by acid stripping with 0.2 M acetic acid and 0.5 M NaCl solution (pH 2.5). After washing with ice-cold PBS-CM, internalized ENaC was detected by immunoblotting (IB) or immunofluorescence microscopy. For IB, cells were scraped in 1 ml of lysis buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM PMSF, 20 Âµg/ml leupeptin, and 1 Âµg/ml pepstatin A). Cells were solubilized at 4Â°C for 1 h on a rotating wheel, and centrifuged at 20,000 Ã g at 4Â°C for 15 min. Protein G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) were added to the supernatant and incubated at 4Â°C for 3 h. The beads were then thoroughly washed with lysis buffer A and boiled in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer. The sample was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), followed by IB with anti-ENaC subunit antibodies. Internalization was expressed as a percentage of the initial amount of cell-surface ENaC subunit determined by incubating cells with anti-FLAG antibody at 4Â°C for 1 h and lysing them without incubation at 37Â°C or acid stripping. For immunofluorescence microscopy, cells were transfected with control or FCHO2 siRNA and then with GFP-siRNA-resistant (sr) FCHO2 mutant. After cells were labeled with anti-FLAG antibody on 4Â°C, they were incubated at 37Â°C for 10 min to allow ENaC endocytosis. After acid stripping, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. The antibody-labeled, internalized Î±ENaC was visualized with a fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody. The percentage of cells with internalized Î±ENaC among cells expressing GFP-sr-FCHO2 was determined using MetaMorph imaging System software. All images were acquired under identical parameters. For TfR endocytosis, a cell surface biotinylation assay was carried out as previously described (Roberts et al, 2001). Briefly, the cell surface was labeled with Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 4Â°C. After cells were incubated with ice-cold quenching buffer (50 mM NH4Cl in PBS-CM) at 4Â°C, they were incubated with serum free medium for 10 min at 37Â°C. Biotin was removed from the cell surface by incubation with ice-cold MesNa buffer (50 mM MesNa, 100 mM NaCl, and 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8). Cells were then incubated with iodoacetamide at 4Â°C. Cell lysates were then incubated with NeutrAvidin beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The beads were boiled in SDS sample buffer. Proteins were analyzed by IB with TfR antibody.</p>\n",

Nedd4L is recruited to FCHO2-generated membrane curvature at the rim of nascent CCPs that ENaC enters. Membrane binding of the C2 domain causes catalytic activation by relieving autoinhibition.

The sample was then concentrated using a Centriprep centrifugal filter unit (Millipore) and centrifuged to remove aggregates. The supernatant was dialyzed against buffer C (20 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.0). The mSA-Î±ENaC sample was further purified by Mono Q anion exchange column chromatography as follows. The sample was applied to a Mono Q 5/50 GL column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer C. Elution was performed with a 50 ml linear gradient of NaCl (0â200 mM) in buffer C. Fractions of 1 ml each were collected. The active fractions (fraction 18â22) were collected and dialyzed against buffer D (10 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, and 0.5 mM EDTA). The mSA-Î±ENaC sample was stored at â80Â°C until use.'\n",

       "<p>The C2-WW-HECT domain ubiquitin ligase Nedd4L regulates membrane sorting during endocytosis through the ubiquitination of cargo molecules such as the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). Nedd4L is catalytically autoinhibited by an intramolecular interaction between its C2 and HECT domains, but the proteinâs activation mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we show that Nedd4L activation is linked to membrane shape by FCHO2, a Bin-Amphiphysin-Rsv (BAR) domain protein that regulates endocytosis. FCHO2 was required for the Nedd4L-mediated ubiquitination and endocytosis of ENaC, with Nedd4L co-localizing with FCHO2 at clathrin-coated pits. In cells, Nedd4L was specifically recruited to, and activated by, the FCHO2 BAR domain. Furthermore, we reconstituted FCHO2-induced recruitment and activation of Nedd4L in vitro. Both the recruitment and activation were mediated by membrane curvature rather than protein-protein interactions. The Nedd4L C2 domain recognized a specific degree of membrane curvature that was generated by the FCHO2 BAR domain, with this curvature directly activating Nedd4L by relieving its autoinhibition. Thus, we show for the first time a specific function (i.e., recruitment and activation of an enzyme regulating cargo sorting) of membrane curvature by a BAR domain protein.</p>\n",

       "<p>Introduction</p>\n",
       "<p></p>\n",
       "<p>Posttranslational modification of proteins by covalent attachment of ubiquitin (Ub) is catalyzed by three enzymes: a Ub-activating enzyme (E1), a Ub-conjugating enzyme (E2), and a Ub-protein ligase (E3) that determines substrate specificity (Hershko &amp; Ciechanover, 1998). E3 Ub ligases are classified into two categories based on their Ub transfer mechanisms: RING finger/U-box E3 and HECT-type E3. The Nedd4 family belongs to HECT-type E3 Ub ligases and consists of nine members, including Nedd4/Nedd4-1, Nedd4L/Nedd4-2, Itch, Smurf1, Smurf2, WWP1, WWP2, NEDL1, and NEDL2 (Ingham et al, 2004; Rotin &amp; Kumar, 2009). They are characterized by a common modular organization, with an N-terminal C2 domain, two to four WW domains, and a C-terminal catalytic HECT domain. While the C2 domain was originally identified in protein kinase C (PKC) as a Ca2+-dependent phosphatidylserine (PS)-binding domain (Nishizuka, 1992), it shows significant diversity in the binding partners, including intracellular proteins and other phospholipids, such as phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] (Lemmon, 2008). The WW domains recognize proline-rich motifs, such as PPxY (PY motif, where x is any residue), of substrates or adaptor proteins. The HECT domain catalyzes the isopeptide bond formation between the Ub C terminus and the substrate lysine residues. At least some of the Nedd4 family members, including Nedd4L, are catalytically autoinhibited by an intramolecular interaction between the C2 and HECT domains (Wang et al, 2010; Wiesner et al, 2007; Zhu et al, 2017). However, the activation mechanism of the Nedd4 family is poorly understood.</p>\n",
       "<p>The Nedd4 family is implicated in a wide variety of cellular processes by regulating membrane trafficking and degradation of components of various signaling pathways (Ingham et al, 2004; Rotin &amp; Kumar, 2009). Among a diversity of substrates, the best-characterized is the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). This channel is composed of three subunits, Î±-, Î²-, and Î³ENaC, each of which possesses two transmembrane segments and intracellular N- and C-termini with a large extracellular loop (Butterworth, 2010; Rotin &amp; Staub, 2011; Rossier, 2014). Each subunit has a PY motif at the cytosolic C-terminus. Nedd4L Ub ligase specifically binds to the PY motif and mediates the ubiquitination of lysine residues on the N-terminus of at least Î±- and Î³ENaC at the plasma membrane. Ub serves as an internalization signal for recognition by adaptor proteins, such as epsin and Eps15, for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) (Traub, 2009). Consequently, ENaC is constitutively internalized through CME. Heterozygous mutations of the PY motif of Î²- or Î³ENaC lead to impaired ubiquitination and endocytosis, resulting in persistence of the channels at the cell surface and increased Na+ absorption in Liddle syndrome, an autosomal dominant form of severe hypertension.</p>\n",
       "<p>The process of CME begins at the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane with the assembly of clathrin with adaptor proteins and transmembrane cargo molecules (Doherty &amp; McMahon, 2009; Traub, 2009). In parallel with this assembly, membrane curvature is generated to form hemispherical clathrin-coated pits (CCPs). This process leads to deep membrane invaginations. Subsequently, the neck of invaginated pits is constricted and severed to separate the newly formed clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) from the plasma membrane. These membrane curvatures are considered to be generated, sensed, and/or maintained by Bin-Amphiphysin-Rsv (BAR) domain superfamily proteins. BAR domains form a crescent-shaped dimer characterized by a specific degree of intrinsic curvature. They bind to negatively charged phospholipids, such as PS, and force membranes to bend according to their intrinsic curvatures, thereby inducing the formation of membrane tubules with specific diameters (curvatures). For example, the diameters of membrane tubules generated by the amphiphysin BAR domain, FCHO2 BAR domain, and FBP17 BAR domain are 20â50 nm (sharper curvature) (Peter et al, 2004; Takei et al, 1999; Yin et al, 2009), 50â80 nm (intermediate curvature) (Henne et al, 2007), and ~150 nm (Takano et al, 2008) (shallower curvature), respectively.</p>\n",
       "<p>The FCHO2 BAR domain has been proposed to trigger the initial invagination for CCP formation (Henne et al, 2010). FCHO2 binds to the flat surface of the plasma membrane at sites where CCPs will form. FCHO2 then generates the initial membrane curvature and recruits the clathrin machinery for CCP formation. Here, we report the role of FCHO2 in Nedd4L-mediated ENaC endocytosis and show that FCHO2 BAR domain-generated membrane curvature induces the recruitment and activation of Nedd4L.</p>\n",

       "<p>Results</p>\n",
       "<p></p>\n",
       "<p>FCHO2 is required for Nedd4L-mediated ubiquitination and endocytosis of ENaC</p>\n",
       "<p>To study the role of FCHO2 in ENaC endocytosis, we established a HeLa cell line stably expressing all three subunits, Î±-, Î²-, and Î³ENaC (Î±Î²Î³ENaC-HeLa cells) (Fig EV1A-C). A FLAG tag was introduced into the extracellular region of Î±ENaC in a position previously shown not to affect channel activity (Firsov et al, 1996). Upon FCHO2 knockdown by small interfering RNA (siRNA) methods, ENaC internalization was reduced, as was upon Nedd4L knockdown (Zhou et al, 2007) (Fig 1 A and B). Transferrin receptor (TfR) internalization was reduced upon FCHO2 knockdown but not upon Nedd4L knockdown (Fig 1C). The phenotype of FCHO2 knockdown in ENaC internalization was rescued by an siRNA-resistant (sr) form of FCHO2 (Fig 1D and Appendix Fig S1). Furthermore, Î±ENaC ubiquitination was reduced upon FCHO2 or Nedd4L knockdown but not upon FBP17 knockdown (Fig 1E and Fig EV2). FCHO2 or Nedd4L knockdown increased Î±ENaC expression at the cell surface (Fig 1E and F). These results suggest that FCHO2 is required for Nedd4L-mediated ubiquitination and endocytosis of ENaC.</p>\n",
       "<p></p>\n",
       "<p>Recruitment and activation of Nedd4L by FCHO2 in cells</p>\n",
       "<p>Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that in Î±Î²Î³ENaC-HeLa cells, cell-surface Î±ENaC co-localized with FCHO2 at clathrin-coated structures (Fig 2A). However, its co-localization with Nedd4L was not detected (Appendix Fig S2A), because exogenous expression of Nedd4L-green fluorescent protein (GFP) stimulated ENaC internalization, resulting in the disappearance of Î±ENaC from the cell surface. Cell-surface Î±ENaC was observed in cells lacking Nedd4L-GFP expression (non-transfected cells). When a catalytically inactive Nedd4L mutant, C922A, was expressed, it co-localized with cell-surface Î±ENaC and endogenous FCHO2 (Fig 2B). The mutant also formed FCHO2-negative spots. In wild-type HeLa cells, Nedd4L accumulated at clathrin-coated structures where FCHO2 localized (Fig 2C). Additionally, Nedd4L formed clathrin-negative spots, suggesting that they may be involved in clathrin-independent endocytosis.</p>\n",
       "<p>Using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, we investigated whether Nedd4L is recruited to CCPs in wild-type HeLa cells. Similar to FCHO2 described previously (Henne et al, 2010; Lehmann et al, 2019; Zaccai et al, 2022), Nedd4L showed dynamic co-localization with clathrin during pit formation (Fig 3). When both fluorescent protein-tagged FCHO2 and Nedd4L were expressed, the accumulation of Nedd4L at FCHO2-positive spots was not clearly observed (Appendix Fig S2B). The reason behind this remains unknown, but it has been shown that clathrin coat formation, measured in time-lapse images of cells expressing fluorescent proteins, is affected by several factors, such as overexpression level, choice of the proteins, and choice of the fluorescent tag (Aguet et al, 2013). These factors may contribute to the failure to detect the accumulation of Nedd4L at FCHO2-positive spots.</p>\n",
       "<p>While Nedd4L shows a punctate staining pattern at the cell surface (see Figs 2C, 3B and 3C), it exhibited diffuse distribution throughout the cytoplasm (Fig 4A and B). In COS7 cells, co-expression of the FCHO2 BAR domain [amino acid (aa) 1-302] recruited Nedd4L to membrane tubules (Fig 4A). The Nedd4L C2 domain (Myc-Nedd4L C2, aa 1-160) was also concentrated to membrane tubules, whereas C2 domain-deleted Nedd4L (Myc-Nedd4L ÎC2) was not. In contrast to FCHO2, the FBP17 BAR domain did not recruit Nedd4L to membrane tubules. Additionally, the BAR domain protein amphiphysin1 did not recruit Nedd4L to membrane tubules. Thus, Nedd4L is selectively recruited through the C2 domain to membrane tubules generated by the FCHO2 BAR domain. Similar results were obtained in HEK293 cells (Fig 4B). In these cells, membrane tubules generated by amphiphysin1 were hardly detected. It showed a punctate staining pattern and did not co-localized with Nedd4L.</p>\n",
       "<p>We also investigated whether the FCHO2 BAR domain not only recruits but also activates Nedd4L in cells. For this purpose, we performed an in vivo ubiquitination assay using HEK293 cells, which formed membrane tubules upon FCHO2 expression more efficiently than did COS7 cells: 91 Â± 2% of HEK293 cells vs. 32 Â± 2% of COS7 cells [the mean Â± standard error of the mean (S.E.M.) of four independent experiments]. As the catalytic activity of E3 Ub ligases is typically reflected in their autoubiquitination (Wiesner et al, 2007), we determined activity by measuring the ubiquitination level of Nedd4L itself. Expression of the FCHO2 BAR domain in cells remarkably enhanced Nedd4L autoubiquitination, whereas FBP17 or amphiphysin1 did not (Fig 5A). Tubulation-deficient FCHO2 mutants (K146E+R152E and L136E) (Henne et al, 2010) did not enhance Nedd4L activity (Fig 5AâC and Fig EV3). A catalytically inactive Nedd4L mutant, C922A, which was recruited to FCHO2-generated membrane tubules, showed little enhancement of ubiquitination upon FCHO2 expression (Fig 5D and E), indicating that Nedd4L ubiquitination is self-induced. Using Î±ENaC as a substrate, we further confirmed that Nedd4L is activated upon FCHO2 expression in cells (Fig 5F).</p>\n",
       "<p></p>\n",
       "<p>Preference of Nedd4L for FCHO2-generated membrane curvature</p>\n",
       "<p>The aforementioned results prompted us to investigate whether FCHO2 and Nedd4L interact through membrane tubules rather than through stereotyped proteinâprotein interactions. Membrane tubules generated by BAR domains in cells have specific diameters (curvatures) (Henne et al, 2007; Peter et al, 2004; Takano et al, 2008; Takei et al, 1999; Yin et al, 2009). Nedd4L may preferentially bind to the specific degree of membrane curvature generated by FCHO2. To investigate this possibility, we first examined the biochemical properties of Nedd4L. Using a co-sedimentation assay with liposomes containing various percentages of PS, we found that the C2 domain of Nedd4L is a Ca2+-dependent PS-binding domain (Fig 6A and B). Submicromolar Ca2+ concentrations, which are comparable to intracellular levels in unstimulated cells, were sufficient for the Nedd4L C2 domain to bind to PS-containing liposomes. The C2 domain alone and full-length Nedd4L showed different Ca2+ requirements. The higher Ca2+ requirement of full-length Nedd4L may be due to the intramolecular interaction between the C2 and HECT domains. Increasing PS percentages in synthetic liposomes enhanced the liposome binding of the Nedd4L C2 domain, and PS requirements varied depending on Ca2+ concentration.</p>\n",
       "<p>We next examined whether Nedd4L preferentially binds to a specific degree of membrane curvature. For this purpose, liposomes of different sizes (curvatures) were prepared by stepwise extrusion through filter membranes with different pore sizes (0.8, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, and 0.03 Âµm) and sonication. Sonication or extrusion through a 0.03 Âµm pore-size filter was used to prepare the smallest liposomes. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the actual liposome size was similar to the pore size for 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, and 0.03 Âµm pore-size liposomes, whereas it was significantly smaller for 0.8 and 0.4 Âµm pore-size liposomes (Fig 7A). Nedd4L showed the strongest binding to 0.05 Âµm pore-size liposomes (Fig 7B).</p>\n",
       "<p>Synaptotagmin I (SytI) tandem C2 domains can both generate and sense membrane curvature in vitro by penetrating their hydrophobic residues into the lipid bilayer (Martens et al, 2007). As a sensor, the binding affinity is considered to be highest for membranes that have a degree of curvature consistent with that generated by SytI itself. We investigated whether, in addition to sensing membrane curvature, the Nedd4L C2 domain can also generate membrane curvature in vitro and, if so, what diameter of membrane tubules is generated. As expected, transmission electron microscopy revealed that the C2 domain deformed liposomes into extensive tubulation (Fig 7C). It should be noted that Nedd4L does not generate membrane tubules in cells (see Fig 4A and B). The tubule diameter generated by Nedd4L in vitro was mainly 40â80 nm, which is consistent not only with the diameter of 0.05 Âµm pore-size liposomes, to which Nedd4L preferentially binds, but also with the diameter of membrane tubules generated by FCHO2 (Fig 7D). These results suggest that Nedd4L shows the highest binding affinity for the degree of membrane curvature generated by FCHO2. It is therefore likely that FCHO2-induced recruitment and activation of Nedd4L are mediated by the degree of membrane curvature.</p>\n",
       "<p></p>\n",
       "<p>Roles of conserved hydrophobic residues in the Nedd4L C2 domain</p>\n",
       "<p>We compared the C2 domain sequence of Nedd4L to those of other Nedd4 family members, SytI, and PKCÎ³ (Fig 8A). SytI C2 domains possess hydrophobic residues (M173, F234, V304, and I367) for penetration into the lipid bilayer to generate and sense membrane curvature (Martens et al, 2007). The Nedd4L C2 domain also has three hydrophobic residues (I37, F38, and L99), which are conserved among Nedd4 family members except for WWP2. We mutated these residues to alanine to produce six mutants, I37A, F38A, L99A, I37A+F38A, I37A+L99A, and I37A+F38A+L99A (triple-A). Any single mutation did not inhibit Nedd4L recruitment to FCHO2-generated membrane tubules (Fig 8B). However, double and triple mutations severely impaired this recruitment. Furthermore, the I37A+F38A and triple-A mutants showed little liposome binding and lost curvature generation (Fig 8C and D). Thus, these hydrophobic residues (I37, F38, and L99) are critical for both membrane binding and curvature sensing and generation. These residues are likely inserted into the lipid bilayer, thereby strengthening the C2 domain interaction with membranes and enabling the sensing and generation of membrane curvature. It has been shown that I37 and F38 are directly involved in Ca2+ binding (Escobedo et al, 2014). The residues may be inserted into the lipid bilayer while binding Ca2+.</p>\n",
       "<p>In the C2 domain of Smurf2, another Nedd4 family member, conserved hydrophobic residues (F29 and F30) are responsible for interactions with the HECT domain (Fig 8A) (Wiesner et al, 2007). Mutation at these residues impairs the interaction between the C2 and HECT domains, resulting in enhanced Smurf2 autoubiquitination by relieving autoinhibition. Consistent with these previous findings, we found that the Nedd4L I37A+F38A mutant, which was not recruited to FCHO2-generated membrane tubules, enhanced autoubiquitination, irrespective of FCHO2 expression (Fig 5D and E). These results suggest that I37 and F38 are critical for interactions with the HECT domain as well as for membrane binding and curvature sensing. Interestingly, the Nedd4L I37A+F38A mutant, as well as the C922A mutant, showed little Î±ENaC ubiquitination (Fig EV4), indicating that membrane binding of Nedd4L is critical for ENaC ubiquitination.</p>\n",
       "<p></p>\n",
       "<p>In vitro activation of Nedd4L by FCHO2-generated membrane curvature</p>\n",
       "<p>To examine the properties of Nedd4L catalytic activity, we carried out an in vitro ubiquitination assay using an Î±ENaC peptide as a substrate. The Î±ENaC peptide possesses a conserved PY motif for interaction with the Nedd4L WW domain, and it is fused with monomeric streptavidin (mSA) (Lim et al, 2013) to bind to liposomes containing biotinylated phospholipids (biotinylated liposomes) (Sakamoto et al, 2017) (Fig 9A and B). We found that Ca2+ and PS were required for Nedd4L catalytic activity (Fig 9C and D), and that 0.05 Âµm pore-size liposomes were most effective in stimulating Ca2+- and PS-dependent Nedd4L activity (Fig 9E). Thus, the properties of Nedd4L catalytic activity are similar to those of its liposome binding. Furthermore, we found that Nedd4L did not ubiquitinate PY motif-mutated (Y644A in Î±ENaC) mSA-Î±ENaC (Appendix Fig S3). These findings are consistent with defects in ENaC ubiquitination observed in Liddle syndrome.</p>\n",
       "<p>We next examined whether membrane localization of mSA-Î±ENaC affects the membrane binding and catalytic activity of Nedd4L. Nedd4L bound only slightly to mSA-Î±ENaC on PS-free (0% PS) liposomes, but the liposome binding was synergistically increased by elevating the PS percentage in liposomes (Fig 9F). By contrast, when free biotin competitively inhibited the binding of mSA-Î±ENaC to biotinylated liposomes, the PS-dependent liposome binding of Nedd4L was significantly reduced, resulting in remarkable inhibition of mSA-Î±ENaC ubiquitination (Fig 9D and F). Thus, membrane localization of the PY motif is critical for membrane binding and activation of Nedd4L. It is, therefore, likely that the PY motifs on membranes, such as ENaC, play a role in enhancing Nedd4L catalytic activity by potentiating membrane binding through interactions with the WW domain.</p>\n",
       "<p>We then reconstituted in vitro FCHO2-induced recruitment and activation of Nedd4L. When liposomes (20% PS) were used, the FCHO2 BAR domain enhanced the liposome binding of Nedd4L (Fig 10A) and mSA-Î±ENaC ubiquitination (Fig 10B). This enhancement was lost when the strength of interaction of Nedd4L with liposomes was increased by elevating the PS percentage in liposomes (~50% PS) (Fig 10C and Fig EV5).ãIn contrast to FCHO2, neither amphiphysin1 nor FBP17 enhanced Nedd4L activity (Fig 10D and Fig EV6A). Similarly, tubulation-deficient FCHO2 mutant (L136E) did not enhance Nedd4L activity (Fig 10E and Fig EV6A). These results are in good agreement with those obtained from in vivo experiments on FCHO2-induced recruitment and activation of Nedd4L. Electron microscopic analysis revealed that mSA-Î±ENaC-associated liposomes were deformed by membrane-sculpting proteins into tubules with diameters similar to those of mSA-Î±ENaC-free liposomes (Fig EV6B and see also Fig 7D). The diameter of membrane tubules generated by FCHO2 is consistent with that of 0.05 Âµm pore-size liposomes which are most effective in stimulating Nedd4L activity.</p>\n",
       "<p>To confirm whether FCHO2-induced recruitment and activation of Nedd4L are mediated by liposomes (i.e., membrane curvature) rather than by proteinâprotein interactions, we conducted two sets of experiments. Initially, we employed synthetic liposomes where 20% PS was substituted with 5% PI(4,5)P2. The FCHO2 BAR domain bound to PI(4,5)P2 as well as PS with high affinity, whereas the Nedd4L C2 domain did not (Fig 11A and B). The FCHO2 BAR domain is known to induce the tubulation of liposomes [5% PI(4,5)P2] (Henne et al, 2010). If Nedd4L could interact through proteinâprotein interactions with the FCHO2 BAR domain binding to liposomes [5% PI(4,5)P2], the BAR domain would facilitate the co-precipitation of Nedd4L in a co-sedimentation assay, thereby stimulating mSA-Î±ENaC ubiquitination. However, the FCHO2 BAR domain did not demonstrate such interactions (Fig 11C and D). Therefore, it is unlikely that Nedd4L interacts with the FCHO2 BAR domain on liposomes through proteinâprotein interactions. Secondly, we employed 0.05 Âµm pore-size liposomes that are most effective in stimulating Nedd4L activity. The diameter of 0.05 Âµm pore-size liposomes is consistent with that of membrane tubules generated by the FCHO2 BAR domain. The BAR domain is, thus, expected not to induce the tubulation of 0.05 Âµm pore-size liposomes. The FCHO2 BAR domain showed similar binding activity toward 0.8 and 0.05 Âµm pore-size liposomes (Fig 12A). When 0.8 Âµm pore-size liposomes were used, the FCHO2 BAR domain enhanced Nedd4L activity (Fig 12B). However, in the case of 0.05 Âµm pore-size liposomes, curvature-stimulated Nedd4L activity was not potentiated by the addition of the FCHO2 BAR domain. If Nedd4L had interacted with the BAR domain, we would have expected potentiation of Nedd4L activity. These results strongly suggest that FCHO2-induced activation of Nedd4L is mediated by membrane curvature and not by proteinâprotein interactions.</p>\n",
       "<p></p>\n",
       "<p>Discussion</p>\n",
       "<p></p>\n",
       "<p>Nedd4L represents the ancestral Ub ligase with strong similarity to yeast Rsp5 which plays a key role in the trafficking, sorting, and degradation of a large number of proteins (Yang &amp; Kumar, 2010). Consistently, Nedd4L regulates a growing number of substrates, including membrane receptors, transporters, and ion channels. Although Nedd4L exists in a catalytically autoinhibited state due to an intramolecular interaction between the N-terminal C2 and C-terminal HECT domains, little is known about its activation mechanism. In this study, we clearly demonstrated that Nedd4L is activated by FCHO2 F-BAR domain-induced membrane curvature. It has been shown that the activity of synptojanin-1, a phosphoinositide phosphatase, is modulated by membrane curvature (Chang-Ileto et al, 2011). Taken together, it is conceivable that membrane curvature serves as a signal for the activation of various enzymes involved in membrane trafficking.</p>\n",
       "<p></p>\n",
       "<p>Unique Properties of the Nedd4L C2 Domain</p>\n",
       "<p>Although both sytI and Nedd4L C2 domains are Ca2+-dependent PS-binding domains that can generate and sense membrane curvature, their properties show a number of significant differences. An interesting difference exists in the degrees of membrane curvatures generated by sytI and Nedd4L: the diameters of their membrane tubules are about 15â20 nm and 40â80 nm, respectively (Hui et al, 2009; Martens et al, 2007). This difference is not simply due to that between tandem and single C2 domains, because it has been shown that the sytI C2B domain alone generates membrane tubules with a similar diameter (Hui et al, 2009). SytI and Nedd4L C2 domains must therefore have respective unique structures that determine the specific degrees of membrane curvatures that they sense and generate.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another important difference between sytI and Nedd4L C2 domains exists in their Ca2+ requirements. SytI C2 domains require Ca2+ concentrations in the submillimolar range to generate membrane curvature (Hui et al, 2009). In contrast, submicromolar Ca2+ concentrations, which are comparable to intracellular levels in unstimulated cells, are sufficient for the Nedd4L C2 domain to sense membrane curvature. This is consistent with the observation that Nedd4L is recruited and activated in serum-starved cells. The different Ca2+ requirements between sytI and Nedd4L C2 domains are reflected in their functions. SytI C2 domains induce membrane curvature in response to an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, which is essential for Ca2+-triggered membrane fusion (Hui et al, 2009; Martens et al, 2007). Thus, sytI C2 domains serve as a Ca2+ sensor and a curvature generator. In contrast, the Nedd4L C2 domain recognizes a specific degree of curvature without an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Therefore, the Nedd4L C2 domain serves as a curvature sensor to regulate the localization and activity of the E3 Ub ligase.</p>\n",
       "<p>A striking feature that distinguishes the Nedd4L C2 domain from other C2 domain proteins (except for at least a subset of Nedd4 family members) is that the Nedd4L C2 domain interacts not only with membranes but also with the intramolecular catalytic domain for its autoinhibition. Mutational experiments have revealed that I37 and F38 residues in the C2 domain are critical for interactions with both membranes and the HECT domain, suggesting that these two interactions are competitive. This idea is supported by the observation that the Ca2+ EC50 value of full-length Nedd4L is much higher than that of the C2 domain. The HECT domain in full-length Nedd4L may competitively inhibit the interaction of the C2 domain with membranes. It is likely that membranes displace the HECT domain from the C2 domain when the strength of the C2 domain interaction with membranes is increased by the preferred membrane curvature. This displacement relieves the autoinhibition, resulting in Nedd4L activation. Thus, the membrane binding of Nedd4L is coupled with its activation.</p>\n",
       "<p></p>\n",
       "<p>Stimulatory and inhibitory effects of the FCHO2 BAR domain on the liposome binding and catalytic activity of Nedd4L</p>\n",
       "<p>The FCHO2 BAR domain enhances both the liposome binding and catalytic activity of Nedd4L when the interaction strength of Nedd4L with liposomes is weak (20% PS) (Fig 10A and B). Conversely, the BAR domain inhibits the binding and activity of Nedd4L when the interaction of Nedd4L with liposomes is increased by elevating the PS percentage in liposomes (~50% PS) (Fig 10C and Fig EV5). Thus, the FCHO2 BAR domain exerts both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on Nedd4L, depending on the PS percentage in liposomes. However, given that 20% PS is comparable to the concentration in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, it is plausible that FCHO2 exhibits only a stimulatory effect on Nedd4L in cells. The mechanism underlying the stimulatory and inhibitory effects in vitro is as follows: when using liposomes (20% PS), Nedd4L hardly binds to liposomes through PS (Fig. 9F and 10A). The addition of the FCHO2 BAR domain enhances the strength of Nedd4Lâs interaction with PS by inducing membrane curvature. Consequently, Nedd4L gains a new binding to liposomes through PS, which augments its catalytic activity. In contrast, when using liposomes (~50% PS), Nedd4L binds to liposome through PS. The addition of the FCHO2 BAR domain hinders the PS-mediated liposome binding of Nedd4L, because FCHO2 and Nedd4L are PS-binding proteins and compete for PS binding in liposomes. Consequently, the BAR domain inhibits the catalytic activity of Nedd4L. This is consistent with the results obtained with 0.05 Âµm pore-size liposomes (Fig 12B). These 0.05 Âµm pore-size liposomes are comparable to liposomes with a higher PS percentage, as the interaction of Nedd4L with liposomes through PS is increased by membrane curvature. Therefore, when using 0.05 Âµm pore-size liposomes, the FCHO2 BAR domain inhibits the catalytic activity of Nedd4L.</p>\n",
       "<p>Based on a model in which a subset of BAR domain proteins, such as FCHO2 and FBP17, drive liposome tubulation in vitro (Frost et al, 2008; Shimada et al, 2007), the FCHO2 BAR domain is considered to polymerize on the liposome surface into spiral dense coats by lateral and tip-to-tip interactions. When using liposomes (~50% PS), it is conceivable that the FCHO2 BAR domain densely packs the liposomes, leaving little free space for Nedd4L binding. Conversely, when using liposomes (20% PS), it is likely that the liposomes are loosely packed, providing ample surface space for Nedd4L binding.</p>\n",
       "<p></p>\n",
       "<p>Model for ENaC Endocytosis</p>\n",
       "<p>Based on the present study, we propose a model for ENaC endocytosis through ubiquitination (Fig 13). First, FCHO2 binds to the plasma membrane and generates a specific degree of membrane curvature. FCHO2 interacts with clathrin adaptor proteins, such as Eps15, and recruits the clathrin machinery for CCP formation (Uezu et al, 2011; Henne et al, 2010). Eps15 has Ub-interacting motifs (Di Fiore et al, 2003). Nedd4L is subsequently recruited to and activated by FCHO2-generated curved membrane at the rim of nascent CCPs that ENaC enters. ENaC is then ubiquitinated and captured by Eps15 which FCHO2 interacts with. Thus, ubiquitinated ENaC is spatially restricted to CCPs and separated from unmodified ENaC. Overall, our findings suggest that in the early stage of CME, a membrane deformation induced by FCHO2 can program, through both the recruitment and activation of Nedd4L, the gathering of a subclass of cargo molecules in CCPs.</p>\n",

For ENaC endocytosis, cells were then incubated with 5 Âµg/ml anti-FLAG M2 in 2 ml of DMEM containing 1% BSA at 4Â°C for 1 h to prevent internalization. After three washes with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mM MgCl2 and 0.1 mM CaCl2 (PBS-CM), endocytosis was allowed by incubating cells in prewarmed DMEM containing 1% BSA at 37Â°C for the indicated periods of time. Endocytosis was stopped by placing cells on ice and washing them with ice-cold PBS-CM. Antibody bound to the cell surface but not internalized was removed by acid stripping with 0.2 M acetic acid and 0.5 M NaCl solution (pH 2.5). After washing with ice-cold PBS-CM, internalized ENaC was detected by immunoblotting (IB) or immunofluorescence microscopy. For IB, cells were scraped in 1 ml of lysis buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM PMSF, 20 Âµg/ml leupeptin, and 1 Âµg/ml pepstatin A).

Protein G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) were added to the supernatant and incubated at 4Â°C for 3 h. The beads were then thoroughly washed with lysis buffer A and boiled in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer. The sample was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), followed by IB with anti-ENaC subunit antibodies. Internalization was expressed as a percentage of the initial amount of cell-surface ENaC subunit determined by incubating cells with anti-FLAG antibody at 4Â°C for 1 h and lysing them without incubation at 37Â°C or acid stripping. For immunofluorescence microscopy, cells were transfected with control or FCHO2 siRNA and then with GFP-siRNA-resistant (sr) FCHO2 mutant. After cells were labeled with anti-FLAG antibody on 4Â°C, they were incubated at 37Â°C for 10 min to allow ENaC endocytosis. After acid stripping, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. The antibody-labeled, internalized Î±ENaC was visualized with a fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody. The percentage of cells with internalized Î±ENaC among cells expressing GFP-sr-FCHO2 was determined using MetaMorph imaging System software. All images were acquired under identical parameters. For TfR endocytosis, a cell surface biotinylation assay was carried out as previously described (Roberts et al, 2001). Briefly, the cell surface was labeled with Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 4Â°C. After cells were incubated with ice-cold quenching buffer (50 mM NH4Cl in PBS-CM) at 4Â°C, they were incubated with serum free medium for 10 min at 37Â°C. Biotin was removed from the cell surface by incubation with ice-cold MesNa buffer (50 mM MesNa, 100 mM NaCl, and 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8). Cells were then incubated with iodoacetamide at 4Â°C.

Here, we show that Nedd4L activation is linked to membrane shape by FCHO2, a Bin-Amphiphysin-Rsv (BAR) domain protein that regulates endocytosis. FCHO2 was required for the Nedd4L-mediated ubiquitination and endocytosis of ENaC, with Nedd4L co-localizing with FCHO2 at clathrin-coated pits. In cells, Nedd4L was specifically recruited to, and activated by, the FCHO2 BAR domain. Furthermore, we reconstituted FCHO2-induced recruitment and activation of Nedd4L in vitro. Both the recruitment and activation were mediated by membrane curvature rather than protein-protein interactions. The Nedd4L C2 domain recognized a specific degree of membrane curvature that was generated by the FCHO2 BAR domain, with this curvature directly activating Nedd4L by relieving its autoinhibition. Thus, we show for the first time a specific function (i.e., recruitment and activation of an enzyme regulating cargo sorting) of membrane curvature by a BAR domain protein.\\n\\nKeywords: Nedd4L; FCHO2; clathrin; endocytosis; membrane curvature.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n'),\n",

E3 Ub ligases are classified into two categories based on their Ub transfer mechanisms: RING finger/U-box E3 and HECT-type E3. The Nedd4 family belongs to HECT-type E3 Ub ligases and consists of nine members, including Nedd4/Nedd4-1, Nedd4L/Nedd4-2, Itch, Smurf1, Smurf2, WWP1, WWP2, NEDL1, and NEDL2 (Ingham et al, 2004; Rotin & Kumar, 2009). They are characterized by a common modular organization, with an N-terminal C2 domain, two to four WW domains, and a C-terminal catalytic HECT domain. While the C2 domain was originally identified in protein kinase C (PKC) as a Ca2+-dependent phosphatidylserine (PS)-binding domain (Nishizuka, 1992), it shows significant diversity in the binding partners, including intracellular proteins and other phospholipids, such as phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] (Lemmon, 2008). The WW domains recognize proline-rich motifs, such as PPxY (PY motif, where x is any residue), of substrates or adaptor proteins. The HECT domain catalyzes the isopeptide bond formation between the Ub C terminus and the substrate lysine residues. At least some of the Nedd4 family members, including Nedd4L, are catalytically autoinhibited by an intramolecular interaction between the C2 and HECT domains (Wang et al, 2010; Wiesner et al, 2007; Zhu et al, 2017).

Among a diversity of substrates, the best-characterized is the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). This channel is composed of three subunits, Î±-, Î²-, and Î³ENaC, each of which possesses two transmembrane segments and intracellular N- and C-termini with a large extracellular loop (Butterworth, 2010; Rotin & Staub, 2011; Rossier, 2014). Each subunit has a PY motif at the cytosolic C-terminus. Nedd4L Ub ligase specifically binds to the PY motif and mediates the ubiquitination of lysine residues on the N-terminus of at least Î±- and Î³ENaC at the plasma membrane. Ub serves as an internalization signal for recognition by adaptor proteins, such as epsin and Eps15, for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) (Traub, 2009). Consequently, ENaC is constitutively internalized through CME. Heterozygous mutations of the PY motif of Î²- or Î³ENaC lead to impaired ubiquitination and endocytosis, resulting in persistence of the channels at the cell surface and increased Na+ absorption in Liddle syndrome, an autosomal dominant form of severe hypertension.'),\n",

In parallel with this assembly, membrane curvature is generated to form hemispherical clathrin-coated pits (CCPs). This process leads to deep membrane invaginations. Subsequently, the neck of invaginated pits is constricted and severed to separate the newly formed clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) from the plasma membrane. These membrane curvatures are considered to be generated, sensed, and/or maintained by Bin-Amphiphysin-Rsv (BAR) domain superfamily proteins. BAR domains form a crescent-shaped dimer characterized by a specific degree of intrinsic curvature. They bind to negatively charged phospholipids, such as PS, and force membranes to bend according to their intrinsic curvatures, thereby inducing the formation of membrane tubules with specific diameters (curvatures). For example, the diameters of membrane tubules generated by the amphiphysin BAR domain, FCHO2 BAR domain, and FBP17 BAR domain are 20â50 nm (sharper curvature) (Peter et al, 2004; Takei et al, 1999; Yin et al, 2009), 50â80 nm (intermediate curvature) (Henne et al, 2007), and ~150 nm (Takano et al, 2008) (shallower curvature), respectively.\\nThe FCHO2 BAR domain has been proposed to trigger the initial invagination for CCP formation (Henne et al, 2010). FCHO2 binds to the flat surface of the plasma membrane at sites where CCPs will form. FCHO2 then generates the initial membrane curvature and recruits the clathrin machinery for CCP formation.

A FLAG tag was introduced into the extracellular region of Î±ENaC in a position previously shown not to affect channel activity (Firsov et al, 1996).

Cell-surface Î±ENaC was observed in cells lacking Nedd4L-GFP expression (non-transfected cells). When a catalytically inactive Nedd4L mutant, C922A, was expressed, it co-localized with cell-surface Î±ENaC and endogenous FCHO2 (Fig 2B). The mutant also formed FCHO2-negative spots. In wild-type HeLa cells, Nedd4L accumulated at clathrin-coated structures where FCHO2 localized (Fig 2C). Additionally, Nedd4L formed clathrin-negative spots, suggesting that they may be involved in clathrin-independent endocytosis.\\nUsing total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, we investigated whether Nedd4L is recruited to CCPs in wild-type HeLa cells. Similar to FCHO2 described previously (Henne et al, 2010; Lehmann et al, 2019; Zaccai et al, 2022), Nedd4L showed dynamic co-localization with clathrin during pit formation (Fig 3). When both fluorescent protein-tagged FCHO2 and Nedd4L were expressed, the accumulation of Nedd4L at FCHO2-positive spots was not clearly observed (Appendix Fig S2B). The reason behind this remains unknown, but it has been shown that clathrin coat formation, measured in time-lapse images of cells expressing fluorescent proteins, is affected by several factors, such as overexpression level, choice of the proteins, and choice of the fluorescent tag (Aguet et al, 2013).

Nedd4L may preferentially bind to the specific degree of membrane curvature generated by FCHO2. To investigate this possibility, we first examined the biochemical properties of Nedd4L. Using a co-sedimentation assay with liposomes containing various percentages of PS, we found that the C2 domain of Nedd4L is a Ca2+-dependent PS-binding domain (Fig 6A and B). Submicromolar Ca2+ concentrations, which are comparable to intracellular levels in unstimulated cells, were sufficient for the Nedd4L C2 domain to bind to PS-containing liposomes. The C2 domain alone and full-length Nedd4L showed different Ca2+ requirements. The higher Ca2+ requirement of full-length Nedd4L may be due to the intramolecular interaction between the C2 and HECT domains. Increasing PS percentages in synthetic liposomes enhanced the liposome binding of the Nedd4L C2 domain, and PS requirements varied depending on Ca2+ concentration.\\nWe next examined whether Nedd4L preferentially binds to a specific degree of membrane curvature. For this purpose, liposomes of different sizes (curvatures) were prepared by stepwise extrusion through filter membranes with different pore sizes (0.8, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, and 0.03 Âµm) and sonication. Sonication or extrusion through a 0.03 Âµm pore-size filter was used to prepare the smallest liposomes. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the actual liposome size was similar to the pore size for 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, and 0.03 Âµm pore-size liposomes, whereas it was significantly smaller for 0.8 and 0.4 Âµm pore-size liposomes (Fig 7A).

Nedd4L bound only slightly to mSA-Î±ENaC on PS-free (0% PS) liposomes, but the liposome binding was synergistically increased by elevating the PS percentage in liposomes (Fig 9F). By contrast, when free biotin competitively inhibited the binding of mSA-Î±ENaC to biotinylated liposomes, the PS-dependent liposome binding of Nedd4L was significantly reduced, resulting in remarkable inhibition of mSA-Î±ENaC ubiquitination (Fig 9D and F). Thus, membrane localization of the PY motif is critical for membrane binding and activation of Nedd4L.

If Nedd4L could interact through proteinâprotein interactions with the FCHO2 BAR domain binding to liposomes [5% PI(4,5)P2], the BAR domain would facilitate the co-precipitation of Nedd4L in a co-sedimentation assay, thereby stimulating mSA-Î±ENaC ubiquitination.

Consistently, Nedd4L regulates a growing number of substrates, including membrane receptors, transporters, and ion channels. Although Nedd4L exists in a catalytically autoinhibited state due to an intramolecular interaction between the N-terminal C2 and C-terminal HECT domains, little is known about its activation mechanism. In this study, we clearly demonstrated that Nedd4L is activated by FCHO2 F-BAR domain-induced membrane curvature. It has been shown that the activity of synptojanin-1, a phosphoinositide phosphatase, is modulated by membrane curvature (Chang-Ileto et al, 2011). Taken together, it is conceivable that membrane curvature serves as a signal for the activation of various enzymes involved in membrane trafficking.\\n\\nUnique Properties of the Nedd4L C2 Domain\\nAlthough both sytI and Nedd4L C2 domains are Ca2+-dependent PS-binding domains that can generate and sense membrane curvature, their properties show a number of significant differences. An interesting difference exists in the degrees of membrane curvatures generated by sytI and Nedd4L: the diameters of their membrane tubules are about 15â20 nm and 40â80 nm, respectively (Hui et al, 2009; Martens et al, 2007). This difference is not simply due to that between tandem and single C2 domains, because it has been shown that the sytI C2B domain alone generates membrane tubules with a similar diameter (Hui et al, 2009). SytI and Nedd4L C2 domains must therefore have respective unique structures that determine the specific degrees of membrane curvatures that they sense and generate.'),\n",

SytI C2 domains require Ca2+ concentrations in the submillimolar range to generate membrane curvature (Hui et al, 2009). In contrast, submicromolar Ca2+ concentrations, which are comparable to intracellular levels in unstimulated cells, are sufficient for the Nedd4L C2 domain to sense membrane curvature. This is consistent with the observation that Nedd4L is recruited and activated in serum-starved cells. The different Ca2+ requirements between sytI and Nedd4L C2 domains are reflected in their functions. SytI C2 domains induce membrane curvature in response to an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, which is essential for Ca2+-triggered membrane fusion (Hui et al, 2009; Martens et al, 2007). Thus, sytI C2 domains serve as a Ca2+ sensor and a curvature generator. In contrast, the Nedd4L C2 domain recognizes a specific degree of curvature without an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Therefore, the Nedd4L C2 domain serves as a curvature sensor to regulate the localization and activity of the E3 Ub ligase.\\nA striking feature that distinguishes the Nedd4L C2 domain from other C2 domain proteins (except for at least a subset of Nedd4 family members) is that the Nedd4L C2 domain interacts not only with membranes but also with the intramolecular catalytic domain for its autoinhibition. Mutational experiments have revealed that I37 and F38 residues in the C2 domain are critical for interactions with both membranes and the HECT domain, suggesting that these two interactions are competitive. This idea is supported by the observation that the Ca2+ EC50 value of full-length Nedd4L is much higher than that of the C2 domain. The HECT domain in full-length Nedd4L may competitively inhibit the interaction of the C2 domain with membranes. It is likely that membranes displace the HECT domain from the C2 domain when the strength of the C2 domain interaction with membranes is increased by the preferred membrane curvature. This displacement relieves the autoinhibition, resulting in Nedd4L activation.

Thus, the FCHO2 BAR domain exerts both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on Nedd4L, depending on the PS percentage in liposomes. However, given that 20% PS is comparable to the concentration in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, it is plausible that FCHO2 exhibits only a stimulatory effect on Nedd4L in cells. The mechanism underlying the stimulatory and inhibitory effects in vitro is as follows: when using liposomes (20% PS), Nedd4L hardly binds to liposomes through PS (Fig. 9F and 10A). The addition of the FCHO2 BAR domain enhances the strength of Nedd4Lâs interaction with PS by inducing membrane curvature. Consequently, Nedd4L gains a new binding to liposomes through PS, which augments its catalytic activity. In contrast, when using liposomes (~50% PS), Nedd4L binds to liposome through PS. The addition of the FCHO2 BAR domain hinders the PS-mediated liposome binding of Nedd4L, because FCHO2 and Nedd4L are PS-binding proteins and compete for PS binding in liposomes. Consequently, the BAR domain inhibits the catalytic activity of Nedd4L. This is consistent with the results obtained with 0.05 Âµm pore-size liposomes (Fig 12B). These 0.05 Âµm pore-size liposomes are comparable to liposomes with a higher PS percentage, as the interaction of Nedd4L with liposomes through PS is increased by membrane curvature.

First, FCHO2 binds to the plasma membrane and generates a specific degree of membrane curvature. FCHO2 interacts with clathrin adaptor proteins, such as Eps15, and recruits the clathrin machinery for CCP formation (Uezu et al, 2011; Henne et al, 2010). Eps15 has Ub-interacting motifs (Di Fiore et al, 2003). Nedd4L is subsequently recruited to and activated by FCHO2-generated curved membrane at the rim of nascent CCPs that ENaC enters. ENaC is then ubiquitinated and captured by Eps15 which FCHO2 interacts with. Thus, ubiquitinated ENaC is spatially restricted to CCPs and separated from unmodified ENaC.

      "Since our results suggested that KDM5C functions as a scaffold and that\n",
      "KDM5C is essential for YY1 binding to a promoter, we asked, whether the\n",
      "demethylase activity of KDM5C is involved in YY1 recruitment. We\n",
      "generated ACHN cell lines that stably expressed KDM5C-WT or its\n",

      "KDM5C-H514A mutant enhanced YY1 chromatin binding. A similar trend was\n",
      "also observed in HK-2 cells (Figure **EV2A**). Because the primary\n",
      "function of KDM5C is to catalyze the removal of methyl groups from\n",

      "H3K4me3 enrichment was clearly observed in the KDM5C/YY1 overlapping\n",
      "region (Figure **4B**), but the opposite trend of YY1 recruitment was\n",
      "observed in KDM5C-depleted cells (Figure **3C**). To further understand\n",
      "the relationship between YY1 recruitment and H3K4me3, we focused on the\n",
      "overlapping regions of YY1 and H3K4me3 (n=11087), which were classified\n",
      "into KDM5C demethylase-dependent peaks (n=9943) and KDM5C\n",
      "demethylase-independent peaks (n=1144), as shown in Figure **4C**.\n",
      "Reduced YY1 ChIP-seq signals were observed in almost all of the\n",
      "overlapping YY1 and H3K4me3 regions (Figure **4D-E**), regardless of the\n",
      "effect of KDM5C on H3K4me3 intensity. We therefore hypothesized that an\n",
      "intact KDM5C JmjC domain, rather than KDM5C histone demethylase\n",
      "activity, is essential for YY1 recruitment.\n",
      "\n",
      "To further explore the mechanism underlying the effects of KDM5C, we\n",
      "evaluated the interaction between KDM5C-H514A and YY1 and found that the\n",
      "mutation did not influence their interaction (Figure **EV3**),\n",
      "indicating that the effect of KDM5C-H514A on YY1 chromatin recruitment\n",
      "was unlikely to be caused by disrupted protein binding activity. Because\n",
      "the catalytic composite JmjN/C domain binds the substrate H3 tail\n",
      "harboring methylated H3K4 and since a previous study revealed that none\n",
      "of the KDM5C PHD domains exhibited strong binding affinity for\n",
      "unmethylated or methylated histones(Iwase *et al*, 2007), we speculated\n",
      "that the replacement of the histidine residue at position 514 with an\n",
      "alanine residue destroyed the integrity of the JmjN/C domain and\n",
      "influenced the chromatin-binding activity of KDM5C. To test this\n",
      "hypothesis, we expressed KDM5C-WT or KDM5C-H514A in HEK293T cells and\n",
      "isolated chromatin-bound proteins. Interestingly, although the protein\n",
      "levels in whole-cell lysates were indistinguishable, H154A exhibited\n",
      "obviously reduced chromatin-binding capacity (Figure **4F**), which\n",
      "might help explain why KDM5C-H514A failed to recruit YY1 to chromatin.\n",
      "In addition, tumor cell proliferation was markedly inhibited only when\n",
      "both of KDM5C and YY1 were depleted in the KDM5C-proficient tumor cells\n",
      "ACHN and 769-P (Figure **4G-H** and **EV1B-C**). The inhibitory effect\n",

      "only moderately restored the growth of ACHN and 769-P double knockdown\n",

      "\n",
      "As a member of the GLI-Kruppel family of zinc finger DNA-binding\n",
      "proteins, YY1 has been proven to regulate genes either by directly\n",
      "binding to a promoter or indirectly by associating with\n",
      "chromatin-remodeling proteins or histone modifiers (Gordon *et al*,\n",
      "2006; Khachigian, 2018). YY1 is frequently overexpressed in many cancer\n",
      "types and reshapes the oncogenic gene expression network(Bonavida &\n",
      "Kaufhold, 2015; Sarvagalla *et al*, 2019). Although YY1 can directly\n",
      "bind to a promoter DNA sequence, the mechanism underlying its\n",
      "recruitment to chromatin is still not fully understood. In addition,\n",
      "although targeting YY1 might be an attractive therapeutic strategy, a\n",
      "robust biomarker to analyze its effect is lacking. In this study, we\n",
      "found that YY1 is a KDM5C-associated protein, and the JmjC domain of\n",
      "KDM5C was essential for the KDM5CâYY1 interaction. Moreover, we\n",
      "demonstrated that KDM5C mediates the chromatin recruitment of YY1, which\n",
      "is important for YY1 binding to promoter regions and the transcription\n",
      "of cell fate-related genes. Importantly, targeting YY1 effectively\n",
      "inhibited the proliferation and tumorigenicity of tumor cells with low\n",
      "KDM5C expression. Considering these findings, we propose the following\n",
      "model: YY1 chromatin recruitment is at least partially dependent on the\n",
      "presence of KDM5C, and in tumor cells with high KDM5C expression, a\n",
      "small amount of YY1 can be recruited to chromatin even after KDM5C is\n",
      "knocked down. In contrast, depleting YY1 in low KDM5C-expressing tumor\n",
      "cells completely eliminated chromatin-bound YY1 and promoted tumor\n",
      "regression (Figure **7**).\n",
      "\n",
      "As a specific H3K4 histone demethylase, KDM5C plays dual roles as both a\n",

      "2015; Shen *et al*, 2016; Shen *et al*, 2021). KDM5C interacts with\n",
      "specific transcription factors, such as MYC(Outchkourov *et al*, 2013;\n",
      "Secombe *et al*, 2007), and downregulates gene expression by reducing\n",
      "H3K4me2/3 levels at enhancer or promoter regions. However, studies,\n",
      "including our previous reports, have shown that KDM5C also upregulates\n",
      "the expression of certain genes, but the relevant molecular mechanism of\n",
      "KDM5C effect on gene expression is unclear(Outchkourov *et al.*, 2013;\n",
      "Scandaglia *et al*, 2017; Zheng *et al.*, 2021). A recent study showed\n",

      "Our finding that KDM5C recruited YY1 to chromatin in a histone\n",

      "the scaffolding function of epigenetic regulators might be critical for\n",
      "tumorigenesis. Indeed, epigenetic inhibitors targeting the catalytic\n",
      "domain often show limited efficacy and intolerable toxicity, and our\n",

      "increase antitumor responses(Miranda Furtado *et al.*, 2019; Nebbioso\n",

      "ele.tag='{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}p' | ele.text='Endothelial cell responses to fluid shear stress from blood flow are crucial for vascular development, function and disease. A complex of PECAM-1, VE-cadherin, VEGF receptors (VEGFRs) and PlexinD1 located at cell-cell junctions mediates many of these events. But available evidence suggests that another mechanosensor upstream of PECAM-1 initiates signaling. Hypothesizing that GPCR and GÎ± proteins may serve this role, we performed siRNA screening of GÎ± subunits and found that GÎ±i2 and GÎ±q/11 are required for activation of the junctional complex. We then developed a new activation assay, which showed that these G proteins are activated by flow. We next mapped the GÎ± residues required for activation and developed an affinity purification method that used this information to identify latrophilin-2 (Lphn-2/ADGRL2) as the upstream GPCR.  Latrophilin-2 is required for all PECAM-1 downstream events tested. In both mice and zebrafish, latrophilin-2 is required for flow-dependent angiogenesis and artery remodeling. Furthermore, endothelial specific knockout demonstrates that latrophilin plays a role in flow-dependent artery remodeling.  Human genetic data reveal a correlation between the latrophilin-2-encoding Adgrl2 gene and cardiovascular disease. Together, these results define a pathway that connects latrophilin-dependent G protein activation to subsequent endothelial signaling, vascular physiology and disease. '\n",

A complex of proteins at cell-cell junctions consisting of PECAM-1, VE-cadherin, VEGFR2 and 3, and Plexin D1 plays an important role in shear stress responses including vasodilation, flow-dependent vessel remodeling, and atherosclerosis(Conway & Schwartz, 2012; Givens & Tzima, 2016). Stimulation of this junctional complex by flow triggers activation of Src-family kinases (SFKs) within seconds, resulting in ligand-independent activation of VEGF receptors and downstream events including endothelial cell (EC) alignment in the direction of flow(Collins et al, 2012). However, the mechanisms by which proteins located at cell-cell junctions can sense forces from shear stress exerted on the apical surface is unclear. Previous work suggests that activation of the junctional complex is not primary but rather requires an upstream event, mediated presumably by another mechanosensor (Conway et al, 2013). '\n",

GPCRs are a large family of cell surface receptors that play a crucial role in transducting signals across cell membranes.  GPCRs undergo conformational changes in response to ligand binding or other stimuli, after which the activated intracellular domain binds to a heterotrimeric GÎ± protein complex and catalyzes the exchange of guanosine diphosphate (GDP) for guanosine triphosphate (GTP). Connections between GPCRs and shear stress have been reported(Chachisvilis et al, 2006; Dela Paz & Frangos, 2019; Erdogmus et al, 2019; Jung et al, 2012; Wang et al, 2015; Xu et al, 2018).

For instance, it has been demonstrated that flow applied to endothelial cells activates GÎ± proteins independent of an intervening GPCR(Dela Paz et al, 2017; Gudi et al, 1998).  It has also been reported that shear stress responses related to PECAM-1 and cell-cell junction require GPCRs but with different GPCRs implicated in different studies.  These studies include reports of ligand-independent activation of a bradykinin receptor(Chachisvilis et al., 2006; Yeh et al, 2008) and the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor S1PR1(Jung et al., 2012).  The purinergic receptor P2Y2 was also implicated, in this case via ATP release downstream of activation of the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1(Albarran-Juarez et al, 2018; Wang et al., 2015), though this pathway has been disputed(Dela Paz & Frangos, 2019). The orphan receptor GPR68 was identified as a shear stress sensor specific to small arteries though the mechanism of activation, including ligand dependence or independence, is unknown(Xu et al., 2018). These studies also vary in the GÎ± proteins implicated, which included different GÎ±i isoforms (Gudi et al, 1996; Jung et al., 2012) and the GÎ±q/11 family(Albarran-Juarez et al., 2018; Chachisvilis et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2015).

However, testing this hypothesis requires measurement of GÎ± activation in live cells.  Unfortunately, indirect GÎ± activation assays using second messengers such as cAMP or calcium are unreliable in the context of fluid shear stress where multiple activating/suppressing pathways are stimulated. We therefore developed pulldown assays for GÎ± based on the specific binding of GTP-loaded GÎ± subunits to effector proteins, namely GINIP for Gi and GRK2 N-terminal domain for Gq (Appendix fig. S3a)(Gaillard et al, 2014; Tesmer et al, 2005).  To facilitate these assays and distinguish specific GÎ± isoforms (especially Gi isoforms), we prepared versions containing an internal GluGlu (EE) epitope tag that does not impair function (Appendix fig. S3B and refs(Medina et al, 1996; Wilson & Bourne, 1995)).  For Gq, to enhance pulldown efficiency, we co-expressed Ric8A, which stabilizes active Gq(Papasergi et al, 2015).  Active, but not inactive, Gi and Gq bound to these effector proteins, while when the artificial GPCR DREADD was expressed, its ligand clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) also activated GÎ± proteins (Appendix fig.

Importantly, this GÎ± pulldown assay showed not only rapid activation of Gi2 and Gq by FSS (Fig. 1G-J), but also differential responses of Gi1 and gain-of-function Gi1(Q306K) to FSS (Fig. 1K, 1L).  Gi activation was unaffected by PECAM-1 knockdown, indicating that this step was upstream or independent of PECAM-1 (Fig. 1M, 1N).

Both constructs localized mainly to the plasma membrane, as did wild-type GÎ± (Appendix fig. S4A).  We further employed detergent-free nanodisc-forming styrene-maleimide anhydride (SMA) copolymer to stabilize GPCR conformation within its native lipid environment(Lee et al, 2016).  This approach was validated by coimmunoprecipitation using GFP-TrapÂ® nanobody beads of GÎ± variants with DREADD GPCR, which showed increased association after receptor activation (Appendix fig.

Furthermore, S1PR1 reportedly activates Gi1 and Gi3 as well as Gi2(Lee et al, 1996), which is inconsistent with the GÎ± specificity defined above.

In control cells, shear stress shifted junctions from an irregular morphology to linear junctions; in Lphn2 knockdown ECs, junctions were indistinguishable in the absence of flow but failed to linearize in flow (Fig. 4A, 4B), demonstrating that the effect is flow-specific.  To further examine contributions of blood flow/latrophilin-2 to ECs in vivo, zebrafish embryos are useful as a developmental system that is amenable to manipulation of shear stress using morpholinos against cardiac troponin T type 2a (tnnt2a; âsilent heartâ)(Sehnert et al, 2002), without global adverse effects.

Our sgRNAs induced >50% cleavage in the T7 endonuclease assays and reduced mRNA levels through nonsense-mediated decay (Appendix fig. S9).

Injecting single cell embryos with silent heart morpholinos at a dose that completely blocked cardiac contractility similarly blocked the elongation of ECs.

Previous studies also identified other GPCRs as mediators of EC shear stress responses, via direct or indirect mechanisms, as well as making claims for GPCR-independent activation of G proteins(Dela Paz et al., 2017). GPCRs implicated in shear stress signaling include bradykinin receptor B2(Chachisvilis et al., 2006), ATP receptor P2Y2(Albarran-Juarez et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2015), sphingosine phosphate receptor S1PR1(Jung et al., 2012), the apelin receptor APJ(Strohbach et al, 2018) and GPR68(Xu et al., 2018). An indirect association of Gq/11 with PECAM1 was also reported, which dissociated upon application of shear stress(dela Paz et al, 2014). Differences in EC location or subtype likely account for some of these effects. For example, GPR68 is expressed specifically in small resistance arteries where it controls vasodilation but had no reported effect on development or patterning(Xu et al., 2018). P2Y2 was also reported to affect vasodilation and blood pressure without reported effects on development or patterning.  It seems likely that differences in local expression may thus explain some of the apparent multiplicity, though additional variables such as modulation by other inputs and coupling to different downstream effectors may also contribute.

Thirty minutes post injection, animals were euthanized by an overdose of isoflurane and tissue samples including aorta were harvested and washed with PBS to remove extra fatty tissues.  Dissected aorta was prepared en face and imaged with an Olympus stereo zoom microscope. To quantify blue color associated with extravasation of Evans blue dye, the original RGB images were converted into HSV color model, and the proportion of the blue regions was calculated as the ratio of pixels with hue angles of 120Â°-240Â° to the entire aorta.

The ligated artery was cut between two sutures. The venous structures and accompanying peripheral nerves were kept intact. The overlying skin was closed with a 6-0 prolene (Ethicon) and disinfected.

Doppler perfusion of the plantar foot was assessed within anatomically defined regions of interest (ROIs; Moor Instruments). The ROI for the plantar foot consisted of the hind paw margins. Procedures for minimal preparation, scanning, and ROI selections have been described in detail previously(Zhuang et al, 2011).

      "Endothelial cell responses to fluid shear stress from blood flow are crucial for vascular development, function and disease. A complex of PECAM-1, VE-cadherin, VEGF receptors (VEGFRs) and PlexinD1 located at cell-cell junctions mediates many of these events. But available evidence suggests that another mechanosensor upstream of PECAM-1 initiates signaling. Hypothesizing that GPCR and GÎ± proteins may serve this role, we performed siRNA screening of GÎ± subunits and found that GÎ±i2 and GÎ±q/11 are required for activation of the junctional complex. We then developed a new activation assay, which showed that these G proteins are activated by flow. We next mapped the GÎ± residues required for activation and developed an affinity purification method that used this information to identify latrophilin-2 (Lphn-2/ADGRL2) as the upstream GPCR.  Latrophilin-2 is required for all PECAM-1 downstream events tested. In both mice and zebrafish, latrophilin-2 is required for flow-dependent angiogenesis and artery remodeling. Furthermore, endothelial specific knockout demonstrates that latrophilin plays a role in flow-dependent artery remodeling.  Human genetic data reveal a correlation between the latrophilin-2-encoding Adgrl2 gene and cardiovascular disease. Together, these results define a pathway that connects latrophilin-dependent G protein activation to subsequent endothelial signaling, vascular physiology and disease. \n",

      "Fluid shear stress (FSS) from blood flow is critical for early vascular development in mice(Lucitti et al, 2007) and zebrafish(Sugden et al, 2017), for homeostatic vessel remodeling in adults(Humphrey & Schwartz, 2021; Vogel et al, 2020), and in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis(Baeyens et al, 2016; Zhou et al, 2014).  A complex of proteins at cell-cell junctions consisting of PECAM-1, VE-cadherin, VEGFR2 and 3, and Plexin D1 plays an important role in shear stress responses including vasodilation, flow-dependent vessel remodeling, and atherosclerosis(Conway & Schwartz, 2012; Givens & Tzima, 2016). Stimulation of this junctional complex by flow triggers activation of Src-family kinases (SFKs) within seconds, resulting in ligand-independent activation of VEGF receptors and downstream events including endothelial cell (EC) alignment in the direction of flow(Collins et al, 2012). However, the mechanisms by which proteins located at cell-cell junctions can sense forces from shear stress exerted on the apical surface is unclear. Previous work suggests that activation of the junctional complex is not primary but rather requires an upstream event, mediated presumably by another mechanosensor (Conway et al, 2013). \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "GPCR/GÎ± protein signaling is an obvious candidate for initiating signaling on this time scale (seconds). GPCRs are a large family of cell surface receptors that play a crucial role in transducting signals across cell membranes.  GPCRs undergo conformational changes in response to ligand binding or other stimuli, after which the activated intracellular domain binds to a heterotrimeric GÎ± protein complex and catalyzes the exchange of guanosine diphosphate (GDP) for guanosine triphosphate (GTP). Connections between GPCRs and shear stress have been reported(Chachisvilis et al, 2006; Dela Paz & Frangos, 2019; Erdogmus et al, 2019; Jung et al, 2012; Wang et al, 2015; Xu et al, 2018). However, the literature on GÎ± proteins and GPCRs in shear stress signaling is highly inconsistent(Chachisvilis et al., 2006; Dela Paz & Frangos, 2019; Jung et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2015).  For instance, it has been demonstrated that flow applied to endothelial cells activates GÎ± proteins independent of an intervening GPCR(Dela Paz et al, 2017; Gudi et al, 1998).  It has also been reported that shear stress responses related to PECAM-1 and cell-cell junction require GPCRs but with different GPCRs implicated in different studies.  These studies include reports of ligand-independent activation of a bradykinin receptor(Chachisvilis et al., 2006; Yeh et al, 2008) and the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor S1PR1(Jung et al., 2012).  The purinergic receptor P2Y2 was also implicated, in this case via ATP release downstream of activation of the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1(Albarran-Juarez et al, 2018; Wang et al., 2015), though this pathway has been disputed(Dela Paz & Frangos, 2019). The orphan receptor GPR68 was identified as a shear stress sensor specific to small arteries though the mechanism of activation, including ligand dependence or independence, is unknown(Xu et al., 2018). These studies also vary in the GÎ± proteins implicated, which included different GÎ±i isoforms (Gudi et al, 1996; Jung et al., 2012) and the GÎ±q/11 family(Albarran-Juarez et al., 2018; Chachisvilis et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2015).  \n",

      "To investigate the roles of GPCR signaling in endothelial flow responses, we first transfected human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to suppress Gs, Gi, Gq/11 and G12/13 classes of GÎ± proteins and assayed EC alignment in flow as our initial readout. Single knockdowns gave either weak (Gi) or no (Gs, G12/13, Gq/11) inhibition of EC alignment in flow (Fig.1A and Appendix fig. S1A-C). However, simultaneous knockdown of Gi and Gq/11 completely inhibited alignment (Fig. 1A), whereas other combinations were ineffective (Appendix fig. S1D, S1E). Activation of SFKs is the earliest flow-responsive event mediated by PECAM-1, followed by VEGFRs and Akt(Tzima et al, 2005). These events were similarly blocked by knockdown of Gi plus Gq/11 but not by single knockdowns (Fig. 1B, 1C and Appendix fig. S1F). Therefore, Gi and Gq/11 act in parallel to initiate PECAM-1-dependent flow signaling.\n",

      "Rescue controls with siRNA-resistant GÎ± variants showed that siRNA-resistant Gq and Gi2 restored cell alignment, whereas Gi1 and Gi3 did not (Fig. 1D and Appendix fig. S2A, S2B).  This unexpected result prompted us to search for residues that are similar in Gq and Gi2 but different in Gi1 and Gi3.  Two residues (using human Gi2 numbering) fit this pattern: D167 in Gi2 corresponds to N in Gi1/3; and K307 corresponds to Q306 in Gi1/3 (Fig. 1E).  Gi1(Q306K), but not Gi1(N166D), rescued EC alignment in flow (Fig. 1F and Appendix fig. S2C).  Consistently, Gi2 mutant lacking K307 (K307Q) could not rescue the defects on flow-induced alignment under the knockdown of Gi plus Gq/11 (Appendix fig. S1G and Appendix fig. S2D).  Therefore, K307 in Gi2 distinguishes the GÎ± subunits participate in flow signaling.\n",

      "K307 lies in the region that specifies coupling with GPCRs(Bae et al, 1999; Flock et al, 2017), suggesting that K307 may determine GÎ± activation.  However, testing this hypothesis requires measurement of GÎ± activation in live cells.  Unfortunately, indirect GÎ± activation assays using second messengers such as cAMP or calcium are unreliable in the context of fluid shear stress where multiple activating/suppressing pathways are stimulated. We therefore developed pulldown assays for GÎ± based on the specific binding of GTP-loaded GÎ± subunits to effector proteins, namely GINIP for Gi and GRK2 N-terminal domain for Gq (Appendix fig. S3a)(Gaillard et al, 2014; Tesmer et al, 2005).  To facilitate these assays and distinguish specific GÎ± isoforms (especially Gi isoforms), we prepared versions containing an internal GluGlu (EE) epitope tag that does not impair function (Appendix fig. S3B and refs(Medina et al, 1996; Wilson & Bourne, 1995)).  For Gq, to enhance pulldown efficiency, we co-expressed Ric8A, which stabilizes active Gq(Papasergi et al, 2015).  Active, but not inactive, Gi and Gq bound to these effector proteins, while when the artificial GPCR DREADD was expressed, its ligand clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) also activated GÎ± proteins (Appendix fig. S3C-S3F).  Importantly, this GÎ± pulldown assay showed not only rapid activation of Gi2 and Gq by FSS (Fig. 1G-J), but also differential responses of Gi1 and gain-of-function Gi1(Q306K) to FSS (Fig. 1K, 1L).  Gi activation was unaffected by PECAM-1 knockdown, indicating that this step was upstream or independent of PECAM-1 (Fig. 1M, 1N).  Flow-mediated activation of specific GÎ± subunits thus corresponds to their requirement in EC flow responses.\n",

      "We next sought to identify the GPCR(s) that mediates flow activation of Gi2 and Gq/11. Although affinity purification is the obvious choice, rapid release of GÎ± proteins from GPCRs after GTP loading limits this approach.  Starting with wild-type and its Q306K mutant, we inserted 1) an internal GFP for affinity purification and 2) four alanines (hereafter ins4A) into helix Î±5, which blocks GTP loading, thereby preventing dissociation from GPCRs even in the presence of GTP(Kaya et al, 2016) (Fig. 2A). Both constructs localized mainly to the plasma membrane, as did wild-type GÎ± (Appendix fig. S4A).  We further employed detergent-free nanodisc-forming styrene-maleimide anhydride (SMA) copolymer to stabilize GPCR conformation within its native lipid environment(Lee et al, 2016).  This approach was validated by coimmunoprecipitation using GFP-TrapÂ® nanobody beads of GÎ± variants with DREADD GPCR, which showed increased association after receptor activation (Appendix fig. S4B, S4C).  Proteomic analysis for GPCRs that associated with Gi1(Q306K) but not wild-type Gi1 in response to FSS (protocol in Appendix fig. S4D), identified S1PR1 and ADGRL3 (Appendix fig. S4E).  However, depletion of S1PR1 did not block alignment in FSS (Appendix fig. S4F, S4G).  Furthermore, S1PR1 reportedly activates Gi1 and Gi3 as well as Gi2(Lee et al, 1996), which is inconsistent with the GÎ± specificity defined above.  We therefore focused on ADGRL family proteins, also called latrophilins (LPHNs).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Latrophilins (1,2 and 3 in mammals) are adhesion-type GPCRs that bind to counterreceptors on neighboring cells and regulate neuronal synapses(Sando et al, 2019).  Although it has been reported that different types of endothelial cells have different latrophilin isoforms, LPHN2 is most widely expressed and is the overwhelming major isoform in HUVECs (Appendix figs S5A)(Maleszewska et al, 2016).  Consistent with the proteomic results, Gi1(Q306K)(ins4A) associated with endogenous LPHN2, which increased upon FSS (Fig. 2B, C). This result strongly suggests that FSS activates LPHN2 to recruit GÎ± proteins. Furthermore, Gi1(Q306K), Gi2, and Gq co-immunoprecipitated with LPHN2, whereas Gi1 did not, indicating that LPHN2 specifically bound to the flow-responsive GÎ± proteins defined above (Fig. 2D).  Importantly, LPHN2 knockdown blocked flow-mediated activation of Gi2 (Fig. 2E, 2F).  Together, these data provide strong evidence that latrophilin-2 mediates GÎ± activation essential for endothelial alignment in response to flow.\n",

      "Knockdown of LPHN2, but not LPHN1 or LPHN3, blocked EC alignment in flow (Fig. 3A, 3B; knockdown confirmed in Appendix fig. S5B, S5C).  LPHN2 knockdown in human aortic ECs similarly blocked flow-induced alignment (Appendix fig. S5D, S5E).  In line with these results, LPHN2 knockdown also blocked Golgi apparatus polarization in flow (Appendix fig. S5F, S5G). LPHN2 localized to cell-cell contacts (Fig.3C and Appendix fig. S6). The flow responsive G1 mutant, Gi1(Q306K), also associated with PECAM-1 following FSS (Fig. 3D). The association between LPHN2-Gi1(Q306K) complex with junctional mechanosensory complex proteins PECAM-1 and VE-Cadherin was detected after 24 hours of flow (Fig. 3D-3G), indicating a persistent interaction. We also assessed the immediate flow-dependent signals. LPHN2 depletion strongly suppressed flow-mediated acute activation of SFKs and Akt (Fig 3H-3J). Thus, LPHN2 colocalizes, physically associates with and is required for signaling through the junctional complex. However, LPHN2 knockdown did not inhibit activation of VEGFR2 by VEGF-A, indicating that LPHN2 functions specifically in response to laminar flow (Appendix fig. S7A, S7B).  \n",

      "Among the 3 latrophilin isoforms in human genome, all rescued flow-mediated endothelial alignment after LPHN2 knockdown (Fig. 3K, expression confirmed in Appendix fig. S8A), indicating functional equivalence; the observed differences are therefore due to differential expression.  EC alignment was rescued by wild type (WT) LPHN2 but not H1071A, which is defective in coupling to GÎ± proteins(Nazarko et al, 2018) (Fig. 3L, expression confirmed in Appendix fig. S8B).  Adhesion-type GPCRs can be activated by internal cleavage by the extracellular GAIN domain which exposures its Stachel peptide as a tethered agonist(Vizurraga et al, 2020). However, the autoproteolysis-defective mutant fully rescued EC alignment (see Fig.3L). Helix-8 is known to endow some GPCRs with mechanosensitivity to membrane stretch(Erdogmus et al., 2019). However, a LPHN2 helix-8 mutant could still rescue EC alignment in flow (Fig. 3L).  Taken together, these findings indicate that latrophilin regulates GÎ± activation required for endothelial flow responses, but activation requires neither the Stachel peptide nor helix-8.\n",

      "Long-term laminar flow stabilizes EC junctions, promoting a linear, continuous morphology associated with barrier function(Kroon et al, 2017) (see Fig.3A).  To test whether the role of LPHN2 in this process, we analyzed junctional morphology in vitro with and without 16h of flow. In control cells, shear stress shifted junctions from an irregular morphology to linear junctions; in Lphn2 knockdown ECs, junctions were indistinguishable in the absence of flow but failed to linearize in flow (Fig. 4A, 4B), demonstrating that the effect is flow-specific.  To further examine contributions of blood flow/latrophilin-2 to ECs in vivo, zebrafish embryos are useful as a developmental system that is amenable to manipulation of shear stress using morpholinos against cardiac troponin T type 2a (tnnt2a; âsilent heartâ)(Sehnert et al, 2002), without global adverse effects.  We employed zebrafish embryos expressing Tg(kdrl:ras-mCherry) to mark endothelial cells(Sehnert et al., 2002) and designed sgRNAs for CRISPR-Cas9 targeting all latrophilin isoforms (adgrl1, adgrl2a plus adgrl2b.1, and adgrl3). Our sgRNAs induced >50% cleavage in the T7 endonuclease assays and reduced mRNA levels through nonsense-mediated decay (Appendix fig. S9). Since Lphn2 is the major endothelial isoform, we performed CRISPR-mediated F(0)/mosaic knockout of adgrl2a+adgrl2b.1 (hereafter Lphn2 mutation), which inhibited elongation and enlargement of ECs in the dorsal aorta (Fig. 4C).  Injecting single cell embryos with silent heart morpholinos at a dose that completely blocked cardiac contractility similarly blocked the elongation of ECs. Furthermore, combining tnnt2a and Lphn2 mutation had no further effect, supporting a specific role for latrophilins in flow sensing (Fig. 4D, 4E).  \n",

      "To address LPHN function in mammals, we crossed Lphn2flox/flox mice with CDH5-CreERT2 mice (Lphn2 ECKO), which were injected with tamoxifen at 8 weeks of age and remained viable 10 weeks later.  The descending thoracic aorta (a region of high laminar flow) of Lphn2 ECKO mice had poorly aligned ECs with irregular junctions (Fig. 4F-H).  Additionally, Lphn2 ECKO increased vascular permeability in the whole aorta, as assessed by Evans blue extravasation (Fig. 4I, 4J). In vitro, flow for 24h increased HUVEC barrier function, which was blocked by LPHN2 knockdown, whereas barrier function in the absence of flow was unaffected (Fig. 4K, 4L). Latrophilins are therefore flow-responsive GPCRs that regulate multiple steps in PECAM1-dependent EC mechanotransduction. \n",

      "We next considered how FSS activates LPHN2. As mutation of the autoproteolytic GAIN domain, which is speculated to be mechanosensitive, had no effect (Figure 3i), we considered alternatives. FSS induces a rapid increase in plasma membrane fluidity, in some cases associated with decreased plasma membrane cholesterol(Butler et al, 2001; Haidekker et al, 2000; Yamamoto & Ando, 2013; Yamamoto et al, 2020). As GPCRs can respond to such changes(Vizurraga et al., 2020), HUVECs were treated with methyl-Î²-cyclodextrin (MÎ²CD) to extract plasma membrane cholesterol.  Treatment with 5 mM MÎ²CD for 1 min reduced plasma membrane cholesterol to the same extent as flow, assayed by binding of the cholesterol-specific probe D4H-Clover3(Liu et al, 2017) (Figure 5A).  No discernable effect on cytoskeletal organization was observed under these conditions (Figure 5B). MÎ²CD treatment also induced GÎ± binding to LPHN2 (Figure 5C) and activated both SFKs and VEGFR2, which were blocked by LPHN2 knockdown (Figure 5D-F). Together with published data demonstrating that cholesterol supplementation blocks flow signaling to these and related pathways(Fancher et al, 2018; Tirziu et al, 2005; Yamamoto & Ando, 2013, 2015; Yamamoto et al., 2020), these results suggest that membrane fluidization can trigger LPHN2 GPCR activation and downstream signaling (Figure 5G).\n",

      "To address roles of LPHN2 in flow-dependent vascular remodeling, we examined zebrafish embryos, where artery lumen diameters are determined by EC shear stress(Sugden et al., 2017). We observed that intersegmental vessels (ISVs) at 48 hours post fertilization had reduced diameters after both latrophilin knockout and blockade of blood flow, with no further effect when combined (Fig. 6A, 6B). At 72 hpf, when intersegmental arteries and veins are distinguishable, the decrease in diameter was observed only in arteries (Fig. 6C). LPHNs are thus required for effects of flow on artery diameter.\n",

      "These results prompted us to examine flow-dependent vascular remodeling in mice.  Femoral artery ligation triggers flow-driven arteriogenesis in the thigh and hypoxia-driven angiogenesis in the calf(Cornella et al, 2017). Following surgery, LPHN2 ECKO mice showed lower blood flow in the foot even at day 1 and markedly slower recovery than WT littermates (Fig. 6D, 6E). To understand these effects, we performed micro-CT of vascular casts after injection of electron-dense bismuth microparticles that label arteries/arterioles but not capillaries due to particle size. Surgery induced an increase in small arteries in WT mice but essentially none in LPHN2 ECKO mice (Fig. 6F, 6G). LPHN2 ECKO mice also had much lower density of small arteries even in the control leg, consistent with lower flow on day 1. Staining for PECAM to examine the total vasculature in leg muscle sections revealed decreased capillary density as well, even at baseline (Fig. 6H, 6I).  LPHN2 ECKO mice thus show low vascular density at baseline and greatly reduced flow-dependent remodeling. As expected from the low vascular density, a treadmill fatigue test (Fig. 6J) LPHN2 ECKO mice showed markedly lower exercise capacity (Fig. 6K, 6L) and impaired oxygen consumption (Fig. 6M). LPHN2 ECKO thus results in vascular defects in vivo, at least in part due to defective EC flow sensing. To address whether these defects were related to shear stress sensing, we examined an in vitro system in which FSS enhances VEGF-induced sprouting into collagen gels(Galie et al, 2014). Enhanced sprouting was completely blocked by LPHN2 depletion with only a weak effect on basal migration (Fig. 6N-6P).\n",

      "These data elucidate a pathway in which fluid shear stress acts through the latrophilin adhesion GPCRs to activate subsequent cellular signaling events and vascular remodeling in vivo, thus connecting time scales from seconds to hours to weeks/months. Previous studies showed that laminar flow induces an increase in plasma membrane fluidity associated with depletion of membrane cholesterol (Yamamoto & Ando, 2013, 2015; Yamamoto et al., 2020).  Our data demonstrate that artificial cholesterol depletion activates flow-induced signals in a Lphn2-dependent manner, suggesting that latrophilins connect physical changes in the plasma membrane to cellular signaling. Latrophilins mediate activation of the PECAM-1/VE-cadherin/VEGFR pathway through both Gi2 and Gq/11, suggesting parallel or redundant downstream pathways.  Consistent with these functional effects, FSS induces physical interactions (direct or indirect) between LPHN2-GÎ± and PECAM-1.  However, LPHNs are not required for activation of VEGFRs by its ligand VEGF.  \n",

      "Previous studies identified either Gi or Gq/11 as mediators of flow signaling(Chachisvilis et al., 2006; Jung et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2015).  It seems plausible that, depending on EC subtype or experimental conditions, either Gi or Gq/11 predominated, which concealed their functional redundancy. Previous studies also identified other GPCRs as mediators of EC shear stress responses, via direct or indirect mechanisms, as well as making claims for GPCR-independent activation of G proteins(Dela Paz et al., 2017). GPCRs implicated in shear stress signaling include bradykinin receptor B2(Chachisvilis et al., 2006), ATP receptor P2Y2(Albarran-Juarez et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2015), sphingosine phosphate receptor S1PR1(Jung et al., 2012), the apelin receptor APJ(Strohbach et al, 2018) and GPR68(Xu et al., 2018). An indirect association of Gq/11 with PECAM1 was also reported, which dissociated upon application of shear stress(dela Paz et al, 2014). Differences in EC location or subtype likely account for some of these effects. For example, GPR68 is expressed specifically in small resistance arteries where it controls vasodilation but had no reported effect on development or patterning(Xu et al., 2018). P2Y2 was also reported to affect vasodilation and blood pressure without reported effects on development or patterning.  It seems likely that differences in local expression may thus explain some of the apparent multiplicity, though additional variables such as modulation by other inputs and coupling to different downstream effectors may also contribute. Understanding this GPCR-GÎ± protein signaling network is therefore an important though complex direction for future work.  The novel pulldown assay and GPCR-GÎ± protein affinity purification protocol developed here may facilitate such efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It is also noteworthy that latrophilins are required only for activation of signaling events including VEGFR2 by flow, but not for activation of VEGFR2 by its ligand, VEGF. PECAM-1 first appears in vertebrates but has multiple other functions in leukocyte transmigration and activation, platelet reactivity and angiogenesis that are independent of flow(Privratsky et al, 2010). Together, these findings argue that latrophilins, in essence, confer flow sensitivity to pre-existing pathways controlled by ligand availability.  \n",

      "Lphn2 mutation in zebrafish and endothelial knockout in mice caused multiple vascular defects that implicate FSS mechanotransduction, including reduced EC alignment in the direction of flow, altered junctional morphology and permeability, smaller artery diameters and defects in arterialization in the hindlimb ischemia model. Lower capillary and small artery density in some vascular beds may also be attributable to defective FSS sensing, as FSS regulates angiogenic sprouting (Galie et al., 2014) and stabilizes nascent vessels once blood begins to flow (Campinho et al, 2020). We note, however, that flow-independent functional roles for Lphn2 in ECs have been observed (Camillo et al, 2021) and likely contribute as well.\n",

      "These results link together many observations to provide a comprehensive model for EC responses to FSS (Appendix fig. S11). These findings are of further interest in light of human genetic data that strongly link the Adgrl2 gene to vascular disease (Appendix fig. S10).  However, the identified polymorphisms reside in regulatory or intronic regions, thus, causal connections to vascular disease are not obvious. Intronic polymorphisms can regulate gene expression but could also be in linkage disequilibrium with causal SNPs that are not yet identified. More detailed population genetic analyses are required to address these issues.\n",

Lastly, combined human genetic and structure-function studies are needed to elucidate the contribution of Lphn2 variants to human cardiovascular disease. \n",

      "Narrative Text: An understanding of the enzymatic and scaffolding functions of epigenetic modifiers is important for the development of epigenetic therapies for cancer. The H3K4me2/3 histone demethylase KDM5C has been shown to regulate transcription. The diverse roles of KDM5C are likely determined by its interacting partners, which are still largely unknown. In this study, we screen for KDM5C-binding proteins and show that YY1 interacts with KDM5C. A synergistic antitumor effect is exerted when both KDM5C and YY1 are depleted, and targeting YY1 appears to be a vulnerability in KDM5C-deficient cancer cells. Mechanistically, KDM5C promotes global YY1 chromatin recruitment, especially at promoters. Moreover, an intact KDM5C JmjC domain but not KDM5C histone demethylase activity is required for KDM5C-mediated YY1 chromatin binding. Transcriptional profiling reveals that dual inhibition of KDM5C and YY1 increases transcriptional repression of cell cycle- and apoptosis-related genes. In summary, our work demonstrates a synthetic lethal interaction between YY1 and KDM5C and suggests combination therapies for cancer treatments.\n",

      "Narrative Text: Epigenetic regulators change phenotype acquisition or gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. By conferring a fitness advantage, mutational or non-mutational epigenetic reprogramming has been implicated in the evolution of tumors during malignant progression and metastasis. In addition, numerous studies have shown that aberrant epigenetic alterations contribute to cancer therapeutic resistance(Hogg et al, 2020; Miranda Furtado et al, 2019; Zafar et al, 2021). Therefore, targeting epigenetic regulators is an attractive strategy for cancer therapy.\n",
      "Narrative Text: The histone demethylase KDM5C is a member of the SMC homolog family. By specifically removing one or two methyl groups from Lys4 in histone H3, the dynamic balance in histone H3K4 methylation is maintained. KDM5C carries a composite catalytic region in which JmjN and JmjC domains are located. JmjC is critical for catalyzing the demethylation of H3K4me2/3, while the JmjN domain interacts with the JmjC domain for the complete catalytic function of KDM5C. H514 is a highly conserved amino acid that is located in the catalytic core of the JmjC domain, and its mutation eliminates KDM5C demethylase activity. KDM5C can suppress transcription by reducing the level of H3K4me2/3 via its demethylase activity; however, whether modulation of H3K4 methylation status is the only mechanism or the predominant mechanism by which KDM5C regulates gene expression is unclear.\n",
      "Narrative Text: KDM5C is frequently mutated or aberrantly expressed in various cancer types. Several studies have indicated that KDM5C is involved in regulating different biological processes in tumor cells through its histone demethylase activity and functions as a tumor suppressor. \n",
      "Text: \n",
      "Narrative Text: For example, the high-risk HPV E6 protein degrades KDM5C in cervical cancer cells, which results in super enhancers activation of the proto-oncogenes c-MET and EGFR by changing the H3K4me3/H3K4me1 ratio(Chen et al, 2018). In clear cell renal cell carcinoma cells, KDM5C inhibits the expression of genes related to glycogen metabolism by reducing H3K4me3 levels at the promoters of these genes, while inactivating KDM5C mutation confers cell resistance to ferroptosis(Zheng et al, 2021). However, the therapeutic strategy for KDM5C-deficient tumors is unknown. Intriguingly, KDM5C has also been shown to promote tumorigenesis, although the exact mechanism is unclear; in general, these observations suggest that KDM5C potentially regulates gene expression via a distinct mechanism.\n",
      "Narrative Text: To better understand the mechanisms underlying how KDM5C regulates gene expression, we screened and thus identified Yin Yang 1 (YY1) as a KDM5C-interacting partner. Targeting YY1 in KDM5C-deficient tumor cells effectively suppressed cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by next generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis with multiple engineered cell lines revealed that KDM5C is essential for YY1 chromatin recruitment, which is partially dependent on an intact JmjC domain in KDM5C. Simultaneous loss of KDM5C and YY1 led to significantly enhanced transcriptional inhibition of a number of essential cell fate genes, elevated the apoptosis rate and led to cell cycle arrest. Our study suggests a novel scaffolding function of epigenetic regulators and provides a rationale for the development of new combination treatments.\n",

      "Narrative Text: YY1 is identified as a partner of KDM5C \n",
      "Narrative Text: Previous studies have shown that KDM5C plays diverse roles in cancer progression. Indeed, a systemic The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) clinical data-based analysis clearly revealed that high KDM5C expression was positively or negatively correlated with cancer patient survival, depending on the cancer type (Figure 1A), reinforcing the idea that KDM5C may exhibit a distinct regulatory effect on gene expression, prompting us to screen the interacting partners of KDM5C. Tandem affinity purification (TAP) was subsequently performed. We generated a HEK293T cell line that stably expressed SBP- and Flag-tagged KDM5C, and the lysates of these cells were incubated with streptavidin-coated beads. The bead-bound proteins were subsequently eluted with buffer containing biotin. Next, the captured proteins were incubated with anti-Flag beads, and the proteins bound to these beads were eluted and analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). The results of the MS analysis indicated that a number of proteins potentially interact with KDM5C, including YY1 (Figure 1B), the overexpression of which has been observed in the vast majority of cancers(Gao et al, 2019; van Leenders et al, 2007). Given the pivotal role played by YY1 in the transcriptional regulation of numerous genes(Meliala et al, 2020), we focused on the interaction between KDM5C and YY1. To confirm their interaction, mutual coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays were performed in HEK293T cells, and the results clearly showed that KDM5C bound to YY1 (Figure 1C). Co-IP with endogenous proteins was also performed and the results confirmed that KDM5C interacts with YY1 in mammalian cells (Figure 1D). In addition, we also performed the semi-endogenous co-IP \n",

To delineate the interaction, a series of KDM5C truncation mutants were constructed and used for further analysis (Figure 1F). We found that multiple regions, including the JmjN and JmjC domains, which are critical for H3K4me2/3 removal, were also involved in the interaction between KDM5C and YY1 (Figure 1G).\n",
      "Narrative Text: YY1 depletion significantly inhibits the proliferation and tumorigenicity of KDM5C-deficient tumor\n",
      "Narrative Text: Many studies have shown that YY1 functions as an oncogene because its overexpression is observed in multiple cancers(Li et al, 2022; Qiao et al, 2019; Wang et al, 2022). YY1 tethers cofactors and promotes or represses transcription, depending on its interacting partner, which includes c-myc and p53(Shrivastava et al, 1993; Sui et al, 2004), prompting us to investigate the role of the YY1 KDM5C interaction in tumorigenesis. To achieve this goal, we first selected human kidney proximal tubular epithelial cell line (HK-2), and several renal cancer cell lines (ACHN, 769-P and RCC4) with different KDM5C and YY1 protein expression levels, as described in our previous studies(Chen et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2021) (Figure 2A). Interestingly, knocking down YY1 in KDM5C-deficient RCC4 tumor cells significantly reduced the colony formation ability of the cells, which was not observed in the KDM5C-proficient tumor cell lines ACHN and 769-P (Figure 2B and EV1B-D). Similar results were also obtained in a CCK8-based tumor cell proliferation assay (Figure 2C and EV1E-F). Notably, tumor growth was markedly inhibited when both of KDM5C and YY1 were depleted, whereas the loss of either KDM5C or YY1 only negligibly influenced ACHN cell growth (Figure 2D).

      "Narrative Text: KDM5C colocalizes with YY1 and contributes to YY1 genome-wide chromatin recruitment\n",
      "Narrative Text: The stimulatory effect of YY1 on tumor cell growth was at least partially dependent on the presence of KDM5C. Given that YY1 always promotes tumorigenesis by increasing oncogene transcription, it is unlikely that YY1 tethers KDM5C because KDM5C has H3K4me2/3 demethylase activity, which is associated with repressed gene expression. A recent study revealed that KDM5B, which is a member of the KDM5 demethylase family, recruited a methyltransferase to suppress antitumor immunity, prompting us to explore whether KDM5C has a scaffolding function similar to that of KDM5B(Zhang et al, 2021). We generated a stable KDM5C-depleted ACHN cell lines (Figure EV1B), and ChIP-seq assays were subsequently performed. As shown in Figure 3A, the intensity of the YY1 binding peak was reduced upon loss of KDM5C, implying that KDM5C might be a general regulator of YY1 activity by mediating its chromatin recruitment. Next, we asked to what extent KDM5C co-localizes with YY1. To evaluate the genomic co-occupancy of KDM5C and YY1, we performed the cleavage under targets and tagmentation (CUT&Tag) assay in the ACHN renal cell line, and the annotation of the YY1 and KDM5C peaks revealed an obvious overlap (n=3645) between YY1 and KDM5C binding events (Figure 3B). Further analyzed revealed a significant overlap, with 7,957 genes being concurrently bound by both YY1 and KDM5C (Hypergeometric test, P=4.87e-17). This overlap accounts for 56.32% of the total genes bound by KDM5C and 66.71% of the total genes bound by YY1. \n",
      "Text: \n",
      "Narrative Text: Moreover, a heatmap and a metaplot analysis revealed that the enrichment of YY1 was reduced after KDM5C was depleted in the peaks (n=3645) where YY1 and KDM5C were directly related (Figure 3C). Reduced enrichment of YY1 was also observed in HK-2 cells with KDM5C depletion (Figure EV1A and EV2A). These results revealed that the intensity of the YY1 binding peaks was partially dependent on the KDM5C protein level in both nontumoral cell and tumor cells, suggesting that KDM5C mediated YY1 chromatin recruitment may represent a universal mechanism of action. The localization of the KDM5C-dependent YY1 binding peaks was subsequently analyzed, and the results revealed that most of the peaks were enriched in promoters (Figure 3D), implying that KDM5C may regulate gene expression via a distinct mechanism.\n",

      "Narrative Text: Since our results suggested that KDM5C functions as a scaffold and that KDM5C is essential for YY1 binding to a promoter, we asked, whether the demethylase activity of KDM5C is involved in YY1 recruitment. We generated ACHN cell lines that stably expressed KDM5C-WT or its enzymatically inactive mutant H514A and performed ChIP-seq to evaluate the effects of KDM5C or its mutants on YY1 recruitment (Figure EV1B). As shown in Figure 4A, ectopic KDM5C WT but not the KDM5C-H514A mutant enhanced YY1 chromatin binding. A similar trend was also observed in HK-2 cells (Figure EV2A). Because the primary function of KDM5C is to catalyze the removal of methyl groups from H3K4me2/3, we evaluated whether H3K4me3 abundance plays a role in YY1 recruitment.\n",

Increased H3K4me3 enrichment was clearly observed in the KDM5C/YY1 overlapping region (Figure 4B), but the opposite trend of YY1 recruitment was observed in KDM5C-depleted cells (Figure 3C). To further understand the relationship between YY1 recruitment and H3K4me3, we focused on the overlapping regions of YY1 and H3K4me3 (n=11087), which were classified into KDM5C demethylase-dependent peaks (n=9943) and KDM5C demethylase-independent peaks (n=1144), as shown in Figure 4C. Reduced YY1 ChIP-seq signals were observed in almost all of the overlapping YY1 and H3K4me3 regions (Figure 4D-E), regardless of the effect of KDM5C on H3K4me3 intensity. We therefore hypothesized that an intact KDM5C JmjC domain, rather than KDM5C histone demethylase activity, is essential for YY1 recruitment.\n",
      "Narrative Text: To further explore the mechanism underlying the effects of KDM5C, we evaluated the interaction between KDM5C-H514A and YY1 and found that the mutation did not influence their interaction (Figure EV3), indicating that the effect of KDM5C-H514A on YY1 chromatin recruitment was unlikely to be caused by disrupted protein binding activity. Because the catalytic composite JmjN/C domain binds the substrate H3 tail harboring methylated H3K4 and since a previous study revealed that none of the KDM5C PHD domains exhibited strong binding affinity for unmethylated or methylated histones(Iwase et al, 2007), we speculated that the replacement of the histidine residue at position 514 with an alanine residue destroyed the integrity of the JmjN/C domain and influenced the chromatin-binding activity of KDM5C. To test this hypothesis, we expressed KDM5C-WT or KDM5C-H514A in HEK293T cells and isolated chromatin-bound proteins.

In addition, tumor cell proliferation was markedly inhibited only when both of KDM5C and YY1 were depleted in the KDM5C-proficient tumor cells ACHN and 769-P (Figure 4G-H and EV1B-C). The inhibitory effect was blunted when KDM5C-WT was re-expressed; in contrast, KDM5C-H514A only moderately restored the growth of ACHN and 769-P double knockdown cells. A similar trend was also observed in the colony formation assay (Figure 4J). In KDM5C-deficient RCC4, cells overexpression of KDM5C-WT largely restored cell sensitivity to YY1 depletion (Figure 4I and EV1D). These result collectively suggest that an intact catalytic domain of KDM5C is required for YY1 recruitment.\n",

      "Narrative Text: To systematically evaluate the effect of KDM5C-mediated YY1 recruitment on gene expression, we performed RNA-seq with shKDM5C, shYY1 or double-knockdown ACHN cells. As shown in Figure 5A-B, the loss of KDM5C or YY1 led to the upregulated or downregulated expression of several genes. In contrast, the simultaneous loss of KDM5C and YY1 resulted in altered transcription of thousands of genes (1511 genes whose expression was downregulated versus 797 genes whose expression was upregulated, |log2FC|â¥1.5, p value<0.05, Figure 5C), indicating that YY1 recruitment by KDM5C likely contributed to gene expression activation. A similar pattern was also observed via RNA-seq with HK-2 nontumoral cells (Figure EV4). Compared with the loss of KDM5C or YY1 alone, double knockdown caused transcriptional repression of a sharply increased number of genes (1099 newly identified downregulated genes in total), as shown in Figure 5D. \n",

      "Narrative Text: Given that depletion of both YY1 and KDM5C led to significant suppression of tumor cell proliferation (Figure 4), we next investigated the gene expression patterns by analyzing the RNA-seq results and found that the expression of several cell cycle- and cell apoptosis-related genes, including JAM3, KNTC1, SMC2, SMC4, LMNB1 and FOXM1, was markedly downregulated in the double-knockdown cell group (Figure 5E). These results were verified by qPCR in ACHN cells (Figure 5F).\n",
      "Narrative Text: We compared the RNA-seq results with our CUT&Tag data, and found that almost half of the downregulated genes (49.96%) in the KDM5C/YY1 double-knockdown group were annotated in the genomic regions where YY1 and KDM5C overlapped, as shown in Figure EV5B. We then analyzed the YY1 peaks at the promoters of individual genes via the IGV browser. As shown in Figure EV5C-D, KDM5C depletion reduced theYY1 peak intensity at the promoters of the indicated genes, and the presence of KDM5C increased the amount of YY1 recruited to these promoters. KDM5C-H514A marginally increased the YY1 intensity in the indicated regions. Moreover, ChIP-qPCR was performed in HK-2 cells and the result revealed that YY1 enrichment at the promoter region of the indicated genes was increased after KDM5C-WT was expressed, whereas KDM5C-H514A failed to increase YY1 binding (Figure EV2C). These results strongly suggest that KDM5C increases the expression of essential cell-fate genes by recruiting YY1 to their promoters. \n",

Similar results were also observed in KDM5C-deficient RCC4 cells after YY1 depletion (Figure 6A). Moreover, double knockdown of KDM5C and YY1 but not loss of either gene individually greatly increased the percentage of apoptotic cells in 769-P tumors. In addition, the absence of YY1 in RCC4 cells induced a significant increase in the percentage of apoptosis cells (Figure 6B). These results confirmed the inhibitory effect of YY1 depletion on KDM5C-deficient cells (Figure 4).

      "Title: Discussion\n",
      "Narrative Text: As a member of the GLI-Kruppel family of zinc finger DNA-binding proteins, YY1 has been proven to regulate genes either by directly binding to a promoter or indirectly by associating with chromatin-remodeling proteins or histone modifiers (Gordon et al, 2006; Khachigian, 2018). YY1 is frequently overexpressed in many cancer types and reshapes the oncogenic gene expression network(Bonavida & Kaufhold, 2015; Sarvagalla et al, 2019). Although YY1 can directly bind to a promoter DNA sequence, the mechanism underlying its recruitment to chromatin is still not fully understood. In addition, although targeting YY1 might be an attractive therapeutic strategy, a robust biomarker to analyze its effect is lacking. In this study, we found that YY1 is a KDM5C-associated protein, and the JmjC domain of KDM5C was essential for the KDM5CâYY1 interaction. Moreover, we demonstrated that KDM5C mediates the chromatin recruitment of YY1, which is important for YY1 binding to promoter regions and the transcription of cell fate-related genes. Importantly, targeting YY1 effectively inhibited the proliferation and tumorigenicity of tumor cells with low KDM5C expression. Considering these findings, we propose the following model: YY1 chromatin recruitment is at least partially dependent on the presence of KDM5C, and in tumor cells with high KDM5C expression, a small amount of YY1 can be recruited to chromatin even after KDM5C is knocked down. In contrast, depleting YY1 in low KDM5C-expressing tumor cells completely eliminated chromatin-bound YY1 and promoted tumor regression (Figure 7).\n",
      "Narrative Text: As a specific H3K4 histone demethylase, KDM5C plays dual roles as both a proto-oncogene and tumor suppressor(Chen et al., 2018; Ji et al, 2015; Shen et al, 2016; Shen \n",
      "Text: \n",
      "Narrative Text: et al, 2021). KDM5C interacts with specific transcription factors, such as MYC(Outchkourov et al, 2013; Secombe et al, 2007), and downregulates gene expression by reducing H3K4me2/3 levels at enhancer or promoter regions. However, studies, including our previous reports, have shown that KDM5C also upregulates the expression of certain genes, but the relevant molecular mechanism of KDM5C effect on gene expression is unclear(Outchkourov et al., 2013; Scandaglia et al, 2017; Zheng et al., 2021). A recent study showed that the histone demethylase KDM5B recruited the H3K9 methyltransferase SETDB1 to suppress antitumor immunity in a KDM5B demethylase-independent manner, implying that the scaffolding function of this epigenetic regulator was important in certain contexts, a finding that has been appreciated to a lesser degree in prior studies(Zhang et al., 2021). Our finding that KDM5C recruited YY1 to chromatin in a histone demethylase-independent manner reinforces the evidence suggesting that the scaffolding function of epigenetic regulators might be critical for tumorigenesis. Indeed, epigenetic inhibitors targeting the catalytic domain often show limited efficacy and intolerable toxicity, and our findings strongly suggest that targeting the scaffolding function should be considered in the development of new cancer prevention strategies and therapies.\n",

In recent years, the induction of synthetic lethality has been applied to the identification of novel drug targets, opening new avenues to tumor-targeted therapy(Nijman & Friend, 2013). Considering the definition of synthetic lethality and the results presented here, we propose that KDM5C and YY1 form a synthetically lethal gene pair, providing a rationale for the clinical treatment of patients with KDM5C-deficient cancer by targeting YY1.\n",
      "Narrative Text: In summary, our work provides mechanistic insight into YY1 chromatin recruitment and suggests an important role for the scaffolding function of the histone demethylase KDM5C. Because proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are used to target and degrade proteins with important scaffolding functions and serve as a potential therapeutic strategy in cancer, future work focusing on the design and synthesis of KDM5C PROTAC drugs is important, and further studies in this research direction are warranted.\n",

      "Narrative Text: The raw data (raw reads) in fastq format were first processed via fastp software to obtain clean data, from which reads containing adapters were removed. The reference genome hg38 and gene model annotation files were downloaded directly from the genome website. The index of the reference genome was built using Bowtie2, and the clean reads were aligned to the reference genome with Bowtie2. After the reads were mapped to the reference genome, MACS2 peak-calling software was used to identify regions enriched with IP over the background. A q-value threshold of 0.05 was used for all of the datasets. Only peaks with counts greater than 200 were retained in the CUT&Tag data. Bedtools reldist and bedtools intersect were used to compare two Chip-seq or CUT&Tag datasets in the global or promoter region. Motif analysis was performed via Homer. Chipseeker was used to analyze genomic distribution.\n",

      "An understanding of the enzymatic and scaffolding functions of epigenetic modifiers is important for the development of epigenetic therapies for cancer. The H3K4me2/3 histone demethylase KDM5C has been shown to regulate transcription. The diverse roles of KDM5C are likely determined by its interacting partners, which are still largely unknown. In this study, we screen for KDM5C-binding proteins and show that YY1 interacts with KDM5C. A synergistic antitumor effect is exerted when both KDM5C and YY1 are depleted, and targeting YY1 appears to be a vulnerability in KDM5C-deficient cancer cells. Mechanistically, KDM5C promotes global YY1 chromatin recruitment, especially at promoters. Moreover, an intact KDM5C JmjC domain but not KDM5C histone demethylase activity is required for KDM5C-mediated YY1 chromatin binding. Transcriptional profiling reveals that dual inhibition of KDM5C and YY1 increases transcriptional repression of cell cycle- and apoptosis-related genes. In summary, our work demonstrates a synthetic lethal interaction between YY1 and KDM5C and suggests combination therapies for cancer treatments.\n",

      "Epigenetic regulators change phenotype acquisition or gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. By conferring a fitness advantage, mutational or non-mutational epigenetic reprogramming has been implicated in the evolution of tumors during malignant progression and metastasis. In addition, numerous studies have shown that aberrant epigenetic alterations contribute to cancer therapeutic resistance(Hogg et al, 2020; Miranda Furtado et al, 2019; Zafar et al, 2021). Therefore, targeting epigenetic regulators is an attractive strategy for cancer therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The histone demethylase KDM5C is a member of the SMC homolog family. By specifically removing one or two methyl groups from Lys4 in histone H3, the dynamic balance in histone H3K4 methylation is maintained. KDM5C carries a composite catalytic region in which JmjN and JmjC domains are located. JmjC is critical for catalyzing the demethylation of H3K4me2/3, while the JmjN domain interacts with the JmjC domain for the complete catalytic function of KDM5C. H514 is a highly conserved amino acid that is located in the catalytic core of the JmjC domain, and its mutation eliminates KDM5C demethylase activity. KDM5C can suppress transcription by reducing the level of H3K4me2/3 via its demethylase activity; however, whether modulation of H3K4 methylation status is the only mechanism or the predominant mechanism by which KDM5C regulates gene expression is unclear.\n",
      "\n",
      "KDM5C is frequently mutated or aberrantly expressed in various cancer types. Several studies have indicated that KDM5C is involved in regulating different biological processes in tumor cells through its histone demethylase activity and functions as a tumor suppressor. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the high-risk HPV E6 protein degrades KDM5C in cervical cancer cells, which results in super enhancers activation of the proto-oncogenes c-MET and EGFR by changing the H3K4me3/H3K4me1 ratio(Chen et al, 2018). In clear cell renal cell carcinoma cells, KDM5C inhibits the expression of genes related to glycogen metabolism by reducing H3K4me3 levels at the promoters of these genes, while inactivating KDM5C mutation confers cell resistance to ferroptosis(Zheng et al, 2021). However, the therapeutic strategy for KDM5C-deficient tumors is unknown. Intriguingly, KDM5C has also been shown to promote tumorigenesis, although the exact mechanism is unclear; in general, these observations suggest that KDM5C potentially regulates gene expression via a distinct mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "To better understand the mechanisms underlying how KDM5C regulates gene expression, we screened and thus identified Yin Yang 1 (YY1) as a KDM5C-interacting partner. Targeting YY1 in KDM5C-deficient tumor cells effectively suppressed cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by next generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis with multiple engineered cell lines revealed that KDM5C is essential for YY1 chromatin recruitment, which is partially dependent on an intact JmjC domain in KDM5C. Simultaneous loss of KDM5C and YY1 led to significantly enhanced transcriptional inhibition of a number of essential cell fate genes, elevated the apoptosis rate and led to cell cycle arrest. Our study suggests a novel scaffolding function of epigenetic regulators and provides a rationale for the development of new combination treatments.\n",

      "Previous studies have shown that KDM5C plays diverse roles in cancer progression. Indeed, a systemic The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) clinical data-based analysis clearly revealed that high KDM5C expression was positively or negatively correlated with cancer patient survival, depending on the cancer type (Figure 1A), reinforcing the idea that KDM5C may exhibit a distinct regulatory effect on gene expression, prompting us to screen the interacting partners of KDM5C. Tandem affinity purification (TAP) was subsequently performed. We generated a HEK293T cell line that stably expressed SBP- and Flag-tagged KDM5C, and the lysates of these cells were incubated with streptavidin-coated beads. The bead-bound proteins were subsequently eluted with buffer containing biotin. Next, the captured proteins were incubated with anti-Flag beads, and the proteins bound to these beads were eluted and analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). The results of the MS analysis indicated that a number of proteins potentially interact with KDM5C, including YY1 (Figure 1B), the overexpression of which has been observed in the vast majority of cancers(Gao et al, 2019; van Leenders et al, 2007). Given the pivotal role played by YY1 in the transcriptional regulation of numerous genes(Meliala et al, 2020), we focused on the interaction between KDM5C and YY1. To confirm their interaction, mutual coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays were performed in HEK293T cells, and the results clearly showed that KDM5C bound to YY1 (Figure 1C). Co-IP with endogenous proteins was also performed and the results confirmed that KDM5C interacts with YY1 in mammalian cells (Figure 1D). In addition, we also performed the semi-endogenous co-IP \n",

      "with YY1 and KDM5C-Flag in 769-P renal cancer cell lines. As shown in Figure 1E, KDM5C clearly bound to YY1. To delineate the interaction, a series of KDM5C truncation mutants were constructed and used for further analysis (Figure 1F). We found that multiple regions, including the JmjN and JmjC domains, which are critical for H3K4me2/3 removal, were also involved in the interaction between KDM5C and YY1 (Figure 1G).\n",

      "YY1 depletion significantly inhibits the proliferation and tumorigenicity of KDM5C-deficient tumor\n",
      "\n",
      "Many studies have shown that YY1 functions as an oncogene because its overexpression is observed in multiple cancers(Li et al, 2022; Qiao et al, 2019; Wang et al, 2022). YY1 tethers cofactors and promotes or represses transcription, depending on its interacting partner, which includes c-myc and p53(Shrivastava et al, 1993; Sui et al, 2004), prompting us to investigate the role of the YY1 KDM5C interaction in tumorigenesis. To achieve this goal, we first selected human kidney proximal tubular epithelial cell line (HK-2), and several renal cancer cell lines (ACHN, 769-P and RCC4) with different KDM5C and YY1 protein expression levels, as described in our previous studies(Chen et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2021) (Figure 2A). Interestingly, knocking down YY1 in KDM5C-deficient RCC4 tumor cells significantly reduced the colony formation ability of the cells, which was not observed in the KDM5C-proficient tumor cell lines ACHN and 769-P (Figure 2B and EV1B-D). Similar results were also obtained in a CCK8-based tumor cell proliferation assay (Figure 2C and EV1E-F). Notably, tumor growth was markedly inhibited when both of KDM5C and YY1 were depleted, whereas the loss of either KDM5C or YY1 only negligibly influenced ACHN cell growth (Figure 2D). These results strongly indicate that \n",

      "KDM5C colocalizes with YY1 and contributes to YY1 genome-wide chromatin recruitment\n",
      "\n",
      "The stimulatory effect of YY1 on tumor cell growth was at least partially dependent on the presence of KDM5C. Given that YY1 always promotes tumorigenesis by increasing oncogene transcription, it is unlikely that YY1 tethers KDM5C because KDM5C has H3K4me2/3 demethylase activity, which is associated with repressed gene expression. A recent study revealed that KDM5B, which is a member of the KDM5 demethylase family, recruited a methyltransferase to suppress antitumor immunity, prompting us to explore whether KDM5C has a scaffolding function similar to that of KDM5B(Zhang et al, 2021). We generated a stable KDM5C-depleted ACHN cell lines (Figure EV1B), and ChIP-seq assays were subsequently performed. As shown in Figure 3A, the intensity of the YY1 binding peak was reduced upon loss of KDM5C, implying that KDM5C might be a general regulator of YY1 activity by mediating its chromatin recruitment. Next, we asked to what extent KDM5C co-localizes with YY1. To evaluate the genomic co-occupancy of KDM5C and YY1, we performed the cleavage under targets and tagmentation (CUT&Tag) assay in the ACHN renal cell line, and the annotation of the YY1 and KDM5C peaks revealed an obvious overlap (n=3645) between YY1 and KDM5C binding events (Figure 3B). Further analyzed revealed a significant overlap, with 7,957 genes being concurrently bound by both YY1 and KDM5C (Hypergeometric test, P=4.87e-17). This overlap accounts for 56.32% of the total genes bound by KDM5C and 66.71% of the total genes bound by YY1. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "Moreover, a heatmap and a metaplot analysis revealed that the enrichment of YY1 was reduced after KDM5C was depleted in the peaks (n=3645) where YY1 and KDM5C were directly related (Figure 3C). Reduced enrichment of YY1 was also observed in HK-2 cells with KDM5C depletion (Figure EV1A and EV2A). These results revealed that the intensity of the YY1 binding peaks was partially dependent on the KDM5C protein level in both nontumoral cell and tumor cells, suggesting that KDM5C mediated YY1 chromatin recruitment may represent a universal mechanism of action. The localization of the KDM5C-dependent YY1 binding peaks was subsequently analyzed, and the results revealed that most of the peaks were enriched in promoters (Figure 3D), implying that KDM5C may regulate gene expression via a distinct mechanism.\n",

      "Since our results suggested that KDM5C functions as a scaffold and that KDM5C is essential for YY1 binding to a promoter, we asked, whether the demethylase activity of KDM5C is involved in YY1 recruitment. We generated ACHN cell lines that stably expressed KDM5C-WT or its enzymatically inactive mutant H514A and performed ChIP-seq to evaluate the effects of KDM5C or its mutants on YY1 recruitment (Figure EV1B). As shown in Figure 4A, ectopic KDM5C WT but not the KDM5C-H514A mutant enhanced YY1 chromatin binding. A similar trend was also observed in HK-2 cells (Figure EV2A). Because the primary function of KDM5C is to catalyze the removal of methyl groups from H3K4me2/3, we evaluated whether H3K4me3 abundance plays a role in YY1 recruitment.\n",

Increased H3K4me3 enrichment was clearly observed in the KDM5C/YY1 overlapping region (Figure 4B), but the opposite trend of YY1 recruitment was observed in KDM5C-depleted cells (Figure 3C). To further understand the relationship between YY1 recruitment and H3K4me3, we focused on the overlapping regions of YY1 and H3K4me3 (n=11087), which were classified into KDM5C demethylase-dependent peaks (n=9943) and KDM5C demethylase-independent peaks (n=1144), as shown in Figure 4C. Reduced YY1 ChIP-seq signals were observed in almost all of the overlapping YY1 and H3K4me3 regions (Figure 4D-E), regardless of the effect of KDM5C on H3K4me3 intensity. We therefore hypothesized that an intact KDM5C JmjC domain, rather than KDM5C histone demethylase activity, is essential for YY1 recruitment.\n",
      "\n",
      "To further explore the mechanism underlying the effects of KDM5C, we evaluated the interaction between KDM5C-H514A and YY1 and found that the mutation did not influence their interaction (Figure EV3), indicating that the effect of KDM5C-H514A on YY1 chromatin recruitment was unlikely to be caused by disrupted protein binding activity. Because the catalytic composite JmjN/C domain binds the substrate H3 tail harboring methylated H3K4 and since a previous study revealed that none of the KDM5C PHD domains exhibited strong binding affinity for unmethylated or methylated histones(Iwase et al, 2007), we speculated that the replacement of the histidine residue at position 514 with an alanine residue destroyed the integrity of the JmjN/C domain and influenced the chromatin-binding activity of KDM5C. To test this hypothesis, we expressed KDM5C-WT or KDM5C-H514A in HEK293T cells and isolated chromatin-bound proteins. Interestingly, although the protein levels in whole-cell lysates were indistinguishable, H154A exhibited obviously reduced \n",

      "chromatin-binding capacity (Figure 4F), which might help explain why KDM5C-H514A failed to recruit YY1 to chromatin. In addition, tumor cell proliferation was markedly inhibited only when both of KDM5C and YY1 were depleted in the KDM5C-proficient tumor cells ACHN and 769-P (Figure 4G-H and EV1B-C). The inhibitory effect was blunted when KDM5C-WT was re-expressed; in contrast, KDM5C-H514A only moderately restored the growth of ACHN and 769-P double knockdown cells. A similar trend was also observed in the colony formation assay (Figure 4J). In KDM5C-deficient RCC4, cells overexpression of KDM5C-WT largely restored cell sensitivity to YY1 depletion (Figure 4I and EV1D). These result collectively suggest that an intact catalytic domain of KDM5C is required for YY1 recruitment.\n",

      "KDM5C cooperates with YY1 to regulate essential cell fate gene expression\n",
      "\n",
      "To systematically evaluate the effect of KDM5C-mediated YY1 recruitment on gene expression, we performed RNA-seq with shKDM5C, shYY1 or double-knockdown ACHN cells. As shown in Figure 5A-B, the loss of KDM5C or YY1 led to the upregulated or downregulated expression of several genes. In contrast, the simultaneous loss of KDM5C and YY1 resulted in altered transcription of thousands of genes (1511 genes whose expression was downregulated versus 797 genes whose expression was upregulated, |log2FC|â¥1.5, p value<0.05, Figure 5C), indicating that YY1 recruitment by KDM5C likely contributed to gene expression activation. A similar pattern was also observed via RNA-seq with HK-2 nontumoral cells (Figure EV4). Compared with the loss of KDM5C or YY1 alone, double knockdown caused transcriptional repression of a sharply increased number of genes (1099 newly identified downregulated genes in total), as shown in Figure 5D. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that depletion of both YY1 and KDM5C led to significant suppression of tumor cell proliferation (Figure 4), we next investigated the gene expression patterns by analyzing the RNA-seq results and found that the expression of several cell cycle- and cell apoptosis-related genes, including JAM3, KNTC1, SMC2, SMC4, LMNB1 and FOXM1, was markedly downregulated in the double-knockdown cell group (Figure 5E). These results were verified by qPCR in ACHN cells (Figure 5F).\n",
      "\n",
      "We compared the RNA-seq results with our CUT&Tag data, and found that almost half of the downregulated genes (49.96%) in the KDM5C/YY1 double-knockdown group were annotated in the genomic regions where YY1 and KDM5C overlapped, as shown in Figure EV5B. We then analyzed the YY1 peaks at the promoters of individual genes via the IGV browser. As shown in Figure EV5C-D, KDM5C depletion reduced theYY1 peak intensity at the promoters of the indicated genes, and the presence of KDM5C increased the amount of YY1 recruited to these promoters. KDM5C-H514A marginally increased the YY1 intensity in the indicated regions. Moreover, ChIP-qPCR was performed in HK-2 cells and the result revealed that YY1 enrichment at the promoter region of the indicated genes was increased after KDM5C-WT was expressed, whereas KDM5C-H514A failed to increase YY1 binding (Figure EV2C). These results strongly suggest that KDM5C increases the expression of essential cell-fate genes by recruiting YY1 to their promoters. \n",

Similar results were also observed in KDM5C-deficient RCC4 cells after YY1 depletion (Figure 6A). Moreover, double knockdown of KDM5C and YY1 but not loss of either gene individually greatly increased the percentage of apoptotic cells in 769-P tumors. In addition, the absence of YY1 in RCC4 cells induced a significant increase in the percentage of apoptosis cells (Figure 6B). These results confirmed the inhibitory effect of YY1 depletion on KDM5C-deficient cells (Figure 4).

      "Discussion\n",
      "\n",
      "As a member of the GLI-Kruppel family of zinc finger DNA-binding proteins, YY1 has been proven to regulate genes either by directly binding to a promoter or indirectly by associating with chromatin-remodeling proteins or histone modifiers (Gordon et al, 2006; Khachigian, 2018). YY1 is frequently overexpressed in many cancer types and reshapes the oncogenic gene expression network(Bonavida & Kaufhold, 2015; Sarvagalla et al, 2019). Although YY1 can directly bind to a promoter DNA sequence, the mechanism underlying its recruitment to chromatin is still not fully understood. In addition, although targeting YY1 might be an attractive therapeutic strategy, a robust biomarker to analyze its effect is lacking. In this study, we found that YY1 is a KDM5C-associated protein, and the JmjC domain of KDM5C was essential for the KDM5CâYY1 interaction. Moreover, we demonstrated that KDM5C mediates the chromatin recruitment of YY1, which is important for YY1 binding to promoter regions and the transcription of cell fate-related genes. Importantly, targeting YY1 effectively inhibited the proliferation and tumorigenicity of tumor cells with low KDM5C expression. Considering these findings, we propose the following model: YY1 chromatin recruitment is at least partially dependent on the presence of KDM5C, and in tumor cells with high KDM5C expression, a small amount of YY1 can be recruited to chromatin even after KDM5C is knocked down. In contrast, depleting YY1 in low KDM5C-expressing tumor cells completely eliminated chromatin-bound YY1 and promoted tumor regression (Figure 7).\n",
      "\n",
      "As a specific H3K4 histone demethylase, KDM5C plays dual roles as both a proto-oncogene and tumor suppressor(Chen et al., 2018; Ji et al, 2015; Shen et al, 2016; Shen \n",

      "et al, 2021). KDM5C interacts with specific transcription factors, such as MYC(Outchkourov et al, 2013; Secombe et al, 2007), and downregulates gene expression by reducing H3K4me2/3 levels at enhancer or promoter regions. However, studies, including our previous reports, have shown that KDM5C also upregulates the expression of certain genes, but the relevant molecular mechanism of KDM5C effect on gene expression is unclear(Outchkourov et al., 2013; Scandaglia et al, 2017; Zheng et al., 2021). A recent study showed that the histone demethylase KDM5B recruited the H3K9 methyltransferase SETDB1 to suppress antitumor immunity in a KDM5B demethylase-independent manner, implying that the scaffolding function of this epigenetic regulator was important in certain contexts, a finding that has been appreciated to a lesser degree in prior studies(Zhang et al., 2021). Our finding that KDM5C recruited YY1 to chromatin in a histone demethylase-independent manner reinforces the evidence suggesting that the scaffolding function of epigenetic regulators might be critical for tumorigenesis. Indeed, epigenetic inhibitors targeting the catalytic domain often show limited efficacy and intolerable toxicity, and our findings strongly suggest that targeting the scaffolding function should be considered in the development of new cancer prevention strategies and therapies.\n",
