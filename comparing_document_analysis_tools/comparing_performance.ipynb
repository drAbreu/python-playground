A complex of PECAM-1, VE-cadherin, VEGF receptors (VEGFRs) and PlexinD1 located at cell-cell junctions mediates many of these events. But available evidence suggests that another mechanosensor upstream of PECAM-1 initiates signaling. Hypothesizing that GPCR and GŒ± proteins may serve this role, we performed siRNA screening of GŒ± subunits and found that GŒ±i2 and GŒ±q/11 are required for activation of the junctional complex. We then developed a new activation assay, which showed that these G proteins are activated by flow. We next mapped the GŒ± residues required for activation and developed an affinity purification method that used this information to identify latrophilin-2 (Lphn-2/ADGRL2) as the upstream GPCR.  Latrophilin-2 is required for all PECAM-1 downstream events tested. In both mice and zebrafish, latrophilin-2 is required for flow-dependent angiogenesis and artery remodeling. Furthermore, endothelial specific knockout demonstrates that latrophilin plays a role in flow-dependent artery remodeling.  Human genetic data reveal a correlation between the latrophilin-2-encoding Adgrl2 gene and cardiovascular disease. Together, these results define a pathway that connects latrophilin-dependent G protein activation to subsequent endothelial signaling, vascular physiology and disease. '\n",

A complex of proteins at cell-cell junctions consisting of PECAM-1, VE-cadherin, VEGFR2 and 3, and Plexin D1 plays an important role in shear stress responses including vasodilation, flow-dependent vessel remodeling, and atherosclerosis(Conway & Schwartz, 2012; Givens & Tzima, 2016). Stimulation of this junctional complex by flow triggers activation of Src-family kinases (SFKs) within seconds, resulting in ligand-independent activation of VEGF receptors and downstream events including endothelial cell (EC) alignment in the direction of flow(Collins et al, 2012). However, the mechanisms by which proteins located at cell-cell junctions can sense forces from shear stress exerted on the apical surface is unclear. Previous work suggests that activation of the junctional complex is not primary but rather requires an upstream event, mediated presumably by another mechanosensor (Conway et al, 2013). '\n",
      "ele.tag='{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}p' | ele.text='GPCR/GŒ± protein signaling is an obvious candidate for initiating signaling on this time scale (seconds). GPCRs are a large family of cell surface receptors that play a crucial role in transducting signals across cell membranes.  GPCRs undergo conformational changes in response to ligand binding or other stimuli, after which the activated intracellular domain binds to a heterotrimeric GŒ± protein complex and catalyzes the exchange of guanosine diphosphate (GDP) for guanosine triphosphate (GTP). Connections between GPCRs and shear stress have been reported(Chachisvilis et al, 2006; Dela Paz & Frangos, 2019; Erdogmus et al, 2019; Jung et al, 2012; Wang et al, 2015; Xu et al, 2018). However, the literature on GŒ± proteins and GPCRs in shear stress signaling is highly inconsistent(Chachisvilis et al., 2006; Dela Paz & Frangos, 2019; Jung et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2015).  For instance, it has been demonstrated that flow applied to endothelial cells activates GŒ± proteins independent of an intervening GPCR(Dela Paz et al, 2017; Gudi et al, 1998).  It has also been reported that shear stress responses related to PECAM-1 and cell-cell junction require GPCRs but with different GPCRs implicated in different studies.  These studies include reports of ligand-independent activation of a bradykinin receptor(Chachisvilis et al., 2006; Yeh et al, 2008) and the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor S1PR1(Jung et al., 2012).  The purinergic receptor P2Y2 was also implicated, in this case via ATP release downstream of activation of the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1(Albarran-Juarez et al, 2018; Wang et al., 2015), though this pathway has been disputed(Dela Paz & Frangos, 2019). The orphan receptor GPR68 was identified as a shear stress sensor specific to small arteries though the mechanism of activation, including ligand dependence or independence, is unknown(Xu et al., 2018). These studies also vary in the GŒ± proteins implicated, which included different GŒ±i isoforms (Gudi et al, 1996; Jung et al., 2012) and the GŒ±q/11 family(Albarran-Juarez et al., 2018; Chachisvilis et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2015).

Single knockdowns gave either weak (Gi) or no (Gs, G12/13, Gq/11) inhibition of EC alignment in flow (Fig.1A and Appendix fig. S1A-C). However, simultaneous knockdown of Gi and Gq/11 completely inhibited alignment (Fig. 1A), whereas other combinations were ineffective (Appendix fig. S1D, S1E). Activation of SFKs is the earliest flow-responsive event mediated by PECAM-1, followed by VEGFRs and Akt(Tzima et al, 2005).

However, testing this hypothesis requires measurement of GŒ± activation in live cells.  Unfortunately, indirect GŒ± activation assays using second messengers such as cAMP or calcium are unreliable in the context of fluid shear stress where multiple activating/suppressing pathways are stimulated. We therefore developed pulldown assays for GŒ± based on the specific binding of GTP-loaded GŒ± subunits to effector proteins, namely GINIP for Gi and GRK2 N-terminal domain for Gq (Appendix fig. S3a)(Gaillard et al, 2014; Tesmer et al, 2005).  To facilitate these assays and distinguish specific GŒ± isoforms (especially Gi isoforms), we prepared versions containing an internal GluGlu (EE) epitope tag that does not impair function (Appendix fig. S3B and refs(Medina et al, 1996; Wilson & Bourne, 1995)).  For Gq, to enhance pulldown efficiency, we co-expressed Ric8A, which stabilizes active Gq(Papasergi et al, 2015).  Active, but not inactive, Gi and Gq bound to these effector proteins, while when the artificial GPCR DREADD was expressed, its ligand clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) also activated GŒ± proteins (Appendix fig.

Importantly, this GŒ± pulldown assay showed not only rapid activation of Gi2 and Gq by FSS (Fig. 1G-J), but also differential responses of Gi1 and gain-of-function Gi1(Q306K) to FSS (Fig. 1K, 1L).  Gi activation was unaffected by PECAM-1 knockdown, indicating that this step was upstream or independent of PECAM-1 (Fig. 1M, 1N).

Both constructs localized mainly to the plasma membrane, as did wild-type GŒ± (Appendix fig. S4A).  We further employed detergent-free nanodisc-forming styrene-maleimide anhydride (SMA) copolymer to stabilize GPCR conformation within its native lipid environment(Lee et al, 2016).  This approach was validated by coimmunoprecipitation using GFP-Trap¬Æ nanobody beads of GŒ± variants with DREADD GPCR, which showed increased association after receptor activation (Appendix fig.

However, depletion of S1PR1 did not block alignment in FSS (Appendix fig. S4F, S4G).  Furthermore, S1PR1 reportedly activates Gi1 and Gi3 as well as Gi2(Lee et al, 1996), which is inconsistent with the GŒ± specificity defined above.

In control cells, shear stress shifted junctions from an irregular morphology to linear junctions; in Lphn2 knockdown ECs, junctions were indistinguishable in the absence of flow but failed to linearize in flow (Fig. 4A, 4B), demonstrating that the effect is flow-specific.  To further examine contributions of blood flow/latrophilin-2 to ECs in vivo, zebrafish embryos are useful as a developmental system that is amenable to manipulation of shear stress using morpholinos against cardiac troponin T type 2a (tnnt2a; ‚Äòsilent heart‚Äô)(Sehnert et al, 2002), without global adverse effects.  We employed zebrafish embryos expressing Tg(kdrl:ras-mCherry) to mark endothelial cells(Sehnert et al., 2002) and designed sgRNAs for CRISPR-Cas9 targeting all latrophilin isoforms (adgrl1, adgrl2a plus adgrl2b.1, and adgrl3). Our sgRNAs induced >50% cleavage in the T7 endonuclease assays and reduced mRNA levels through nonsense-mediated decay (Appendix fig. S9). Since Lphn2 is the major endothelial isoform, we performed CRISPR-mediated F(0)/mosaic knockout of adgrl2a+adgrl2b.1 (hereafter Lphn2 mutation), which inhibited elongation and enlargement of ECs in the dorsal aorta (Fig. 4C).  Injecting single cell embryos with silent heart morpholinos at a dose that completely blocked cardiac contractility similarly blocked the elongation of ECs.

As GPCRs can respond to such changes(Vizurraga et al., 2020), HUVECs were treated with methyl-Œ≤-cyclodextrin (MŒ≤CD) to extract plasma membrane cholesterol.  Treatment with 5 mM MŒ≤CD for 1 min reduced plasma membrane cholesterol to the same extent as flow, assayed by binding of the cholesterol-specific probe D4H-Clover3(Liu et al, 2017) (Figure 5A).  No discernable effect on cytoskeletal organization was observed under these conditions (Figure 5B). MŒ≤CD treatment also induced GŒ± binding to LPHN2 (Figure 5C) and activated both SFKs and VEGFR2, which were blocked by LPHN2 knockdown (Figure 5D-F).

To understand these effects, we performed micro-CT of vascular casts after injection of electron-dense bismuth microparticles that label arteries/arterioles but not capillaries due to particle size. Surgery induced an increase in small arteries in WT mice but essentially none in LPHN2 ECKO mice (Fig. 6F, 6G). LPHN2 ECKO mice also had much lower density of small arteries even in the control leg, consistent with lower flow on day 1. Staining for PECAM to examine the total vasculature in leg muscle sections revealed decreased capillary density as well, even at baseline (Fig. 6H, 6I).  LPHN2 ECKO mice thus show low vascular density at baseline and greatly reduced flow-dependent remodeling. As expected from the low vascular density, a treadmill fatigue test (Fig. 6J) LPHN2 ECKO mice showed markedly lower exercise capacity (Fig. 6K, 6L) and impaired oxygen consumption (Fig. 6M). LPHN2 ECKO thus results in vascular defects in vivo, at least in part due to defective EC flow sensing.

Our data demonstrate that artificial cholesterol depletion activates flow-induced signals in a Lphn2-dependent manner, suggesting that latrophilins connect physical changes in the plasma membrane to cellular signaling. Latrophilins mediate activation of the PECAM-1/VE-cadherin/VEGFR pathway through both Gi2 and Gq/11, suggesting parallel or redundant downstream pathways.

Previous studies also identified other GPCRs as mediators of EC shear stress responses, via direct or indirect mechanisms, as well as making claims for GPCR-independent activation of G proteins(Dela Paz et al., 2017). GPCRs implicated in shear stress signaling include bradykinin receptor B2(Chachisvilis et al., 2006), ATP receptor P2Y2(Albarran-Juarez et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2015), sphingosine phosphate receptor S1PR1(Jung et al., 2012), the apelin receptor APJ(Strohbach et al, 2018) and GPR68(Xu et al., 2018). An indirect association of Gq/11 with PECAM1 was also reported, which dissociated upon application of shear stress(dela Paz et al, 2014). Differences in EC location or subtype likely account for some of these effects. For example, GPR68 is expressed specifically in small resistance arteries where it controls vasodilation but had no reported effect on development or patterning(Xu et al., 2018). P2Y2 was also reported to affect vasodilation and blood pressure without reported effects on development or patterning.  It seems likely that differences in local expression may thus explain some of the apparent multiplicity, though additional variables such as modulation by other inputs and coupling to different downstream effectors may also contribute.

The hindquarters were placed on the top of a heater pad during scanning to minimize variation in body temperature. Doppler perfusion of the plantar foot was assessed within anatomically defined regions of interest (ROIs; Moor Instruments). The ROI for the plantar foot consisted of the hind paw margins. Procedures for minimal preparation, scanning, and ROI selections have been described in detail previously(Zhuang et al, 2011). Low or no perfusion is displayed as dark blue, whereas the highest degree of perfusion is displayed as red. These images were quantitatively converted into histograms that represented the amount of blood flow on the x-axis and the number of pixels on the y-axis in the traced area. The average blood flow in each histogram was calculated and the LDI index was determined as the ratio of ischemic to non-ischemic hindlimb blood perfusion.'\n",

The mice were then immediately chilled on ice for more than 30 min and immersion-fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde overnight. The peripheral vasculature in the ischemic hindlimb and the contralateral normal hindlimb was imaged with a high-resolution micro-CT imaging system (GE eXplore Locus SP), set to a 0.007-mm effective detector pixel size. Microview software (GE Healthcare) was used for initial reconstruction. Advanced workstation with various software was used for 3D reconstruction and segmentation of the whole hindlimb at the 21 ¬µm spatial resolution. Using the knee as the breakpoint, we re-sliced the 3D vasculature into 200 slices both in the thigh and in the calf regions. Quantification was performed by use of a NIH Image. The data were expressed as vascular segment numbers, representing the total number of vessels, of specified diameter, counted in 200\\xa0z-sections for the thigh region and another 200\\xa0z-sections for the calf region.'\n",

Nedd4L is catalytically autoinhibited by an intramolecular interaction between its C2 and HECT domains, but the protein‚Äôs activation mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we show that Nedd4L activation is linked to membrane shape by FCHO2, a Bin-Amphiphysin-Rsv (BAR) domain protein that regulates endocytosis. FCHO2 was required for the Nedd4L-mediated ubiquitination and endocytosis of ENaC, with Nedd4L co-localizing with FCHO2 at clathrin-coated pits. In cells, Nedd4L was specifically recruited to, and activated by, the FCHO2 BAR domain. Furthermore, we reconstituted FCHO2-induced recruitment and activation of Nedd4L in vitro. Both the recruitment and activation were mediated by membrane curvature rather than protein-protein interactions. The Nedd4L C2 domain recognized a specific degree of membrane curvature that was generated by the FCHO2 BAR domain, with this curvature directly activating Nedd4L by relieving its autoinhibition. Thus, we show for the first time a specific function (i.e., recruitment and activation of an enzyme regulating cargo sorting) of membrane curvature by a BAR domain protein.'\n",

      "ele.tag='{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}p' | ele.text='Posttranslational modification of proteins by covalent attachment of ubiquitin (Ub) is catalyzed by three enzymes: a Ub-activating enzyme (E1), a Ub-conjugating enzyme (E2), and a Ub-protein ligase (E3) that determines substrate specificity (Hershko & Ciechanover, 1998). E3 Ub ligases are classified into two categories based on their Ub transfer mechanisms: RING finger/U-box E3 and HECT-type E3. The Nedd4 family belongs to HECT-type E3 Ub ligases and consists of nine members, including Nedd4/Nedd4-1, Nedd4L/Nedd4-2, Itch, Smurf1, Smurf2, WWP1, WWP2, NEDL1, and NEDL2 (Ingham et al, 2004; Rotin & Kumar, 2009). They are characterized by a common modular organization, with an N-terminal C2 domain, two to four WW domains, and a C-terminal catalytic HECT domain. While the C2 domain was originally identified in protein kinase C (PKC) as a Ca2+-dependent phosphatidylserine (PS)-binding domain (Nishizuka, 1992), it shows significant diversity in the binding partners, including intracellular proteins and other phospholipids, such as phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] (Lemmon, 2008). The WW domains recognize proline-rich motifs, such as PPxY (PY motif, where x is any residue), of substrates or adaptor proteins. The HECT domain catalyzes the isopeptide bond formation between the Ub C terminus and the substrate lysine residues. At least some of the Nedd4 family members, including Nedd4L, are catalytically autoinhibited by an intramolecular interaction between the C2 and HECT domains (Wang et al, 2010; Wiesner et al, 2007; Zhu et al, 2017). However, the activation mechanism of the Nedd4 family is poorly understood. '\n",
      "ele.tag='{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}p' | ele.text='The Nedd4 family is implicated in a wide variety of cellular processes by regulating membrane trafficking and degradation of components of various signaling pathways (Ingham et al, 2004; Rotin & Kumar, 2009). Among a diversity of substrates, the best-characterized is the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). This channel is composed of three subunits, Œ±-, Œ≤-, and Œ≥ENaC, each of which possesses two transmembrane segments and intracellular N- and C-termini with a large extracellular loop (Butterworth, 2010; Rotin & Staub, 2011; Rossier, 2014). Each subunit has a PY motif at the cytosolic C-terminus. Nedd4L Ub ligase specifically binds to the PY motif and mediates the ubiquitination of lysine residues on the N-terminus of at least Œ±- and Œ≥ENaC at the plasma membrane. Ub serves as an internalization signal for recognition by adaptor proteins, such as epsin and Eps15, for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) (Traub, 2009). Consequently, ENaC is constitutively internalized through CME. Heterozygous mutations of the PY motif of Œ≤- or Œ≥ENaC lead to impaired ubiquitination and endocytosis, resulting in persistence of the channels at the cell surface and increased Na+ absorption in Liddle syndrome, an autosomal dominant form of severe hypertension. '\n",
      "ele.tag='{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}p' | ele.text='The process of CME begins at the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane with the assembly of clathrin with adaptor proteins and transmembrane cargo molecules (Doherty & McMahon, 2009; Traub, 2009). In parallel with this assembly, membrane curvature is generated to form hemispherical clathrin-coated pits (CCPs). This process leads to deep membrane invaginations. Subsequently, the neck of invaginated pits is constricted and severed to separate the newly formed clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) from the plasma membrane. These membrane curvatures are considered to be generated, sensed, and/or maintained by Bin-Amphiphysin-Rsv (BAR) domain superfamily proteins. BAR domains form a crescent-shaped dimer characterized by a specific degree of intrinsic curvature. They bind to negatively charged phospholipids, such as PS, and force membranes to bend according to their intrinsic curvatures, thereby inducing the formation of membrane tubules with specific diameters (curvatures). For example, the diameters of membrane tubules generated by the amphiphysin BAR domain, FCHO2 BAR domain, and FBP17 BAR domain are 20‚Äì50 nm (sharper curvature) (Peter et al, 2004; Takei et al, 1999; Yin et al, 2009), 50‚Äì80 nm (intermediate curvature) (Henne et al, 2007), and ~150 nm (Takano et al, 2008) (shallower curvature), respectively.'\n",

The HECT domain in full-length Nedd4L may competitively inhibit the interaction of the C2 domain with membranes. It is likely that membranes displace the HECT domain from the C2 domain when the strength of the C2 domain interaction with membranes is increased by the preferred membrane curvature.

Thus, the FCHO2 BAR domain exerts both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on Nedd4L, depending on the PS percentage in liposomes. However, given that 20% PS is comparable to the concentration in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, it is plausible that FCHO2 exhibits only a stimulatory effect on Nedd4L in cells. The mechanism underlying the stimulatory and inhibitory effects in vitro is as follows: when using liposomes (20% PS), Nedd4L hardly binds to liposomes through PS (Fig. 9F and 10A). The addition of the FCHO2 BAR domain enhances the strength of Nedd4L‚Äôs interaction with PS by inducing membrane curvature. Consequently, Nedd4L gains a new binding to liposomes through PS, which augments its catalytic activity. In contrast, when using liposomes (~50% PS), Nedd4L binds to liposome through PS.

Conversely, when using liposomes (20% PS), it is likely that the liposomes are loosely packed, providing ample surface space for Nedd4L binding. '\n",

      "ele.tag='{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}p' | ele.text='Based on the present study, we propose a model for ENaC endocytosis through ubiquitination (Fig 13). First, FCHO2 binds to the plasma membrane and generates a specific degree of membrane curvature. FCHO2 interacts with clathrin adaptor proteins, such as Eps15, and recruits the clathrin machinery for CCP formation (Uezu et al, 2011; Henne et al, 2010). Eps15 has Ub-interacting motifs (Di Fiore et al, 2003). Nedd4L is subsequently recruited to and activated by FCHO2-generated curved membrane at the rim of nascent CCPs that ENaC enters. ENaC is then ubiquitinated and captured by Eps15 which FCHO2 interacts with. Thus, ubiquitinated ENaC is spatially restricted to CCPs and separated from unmodified ENaC. Overall, our findings suggest that in the early stage of CME, a membrane deformation induced by FCHO2 can program, through both the recruitment and activation of Nedd4L, the gathering of a subclass of cargo molecules in CCPs.'\n",

TEs are a major source of endogenous dsRNAs, signaling molecules able to coordinate inflammatory responses in various physiological processes. Here, we provide evidence for a positive involvement of TEs in inflammation-driven bone repair and mineralization. In newly fractured mice bone, we observed an early transient upregulation of repeats occurring concurrently with the initiation of the inflammatory stage. In human bone biopsies, analysis revealed a significant correlation between repeats expression, mechanical stress and bone mineral density. We investigated a potential link between LINE-1 (L1) expression and bone mineralization by delivering a synthetic L1 RNA to osteoporotic patient-derived mesenchymal stem cells and observed a dsRNA-triggered protein kinase (PKR)-mediated stress response that led to strongly increased mineralization. This response was associated with a strong and transient inflammation, accompanied by a global translation attenuation induced by eIF2a phosphorylation. We demonstrated that L1 transfection reshaped the secretory profile of osteoblasts, triggering a paracrine activity that stimulated the mineralization of recipient cells. '\n",

Indeed, sterile inflammation is a fundamental component of the osteogenic microenvironment: the inflammatory reaction is the earliest response to injury and is crucial to initiate and orchestrate fracture repair and activate bone anabolic processes. (Mountziaris et al, 2011) (Marsell & Einhorn, 2011) (Bahney et al, 2019) Accordingly, a dysregulated inflammation negatively impacts optimal bone regeneration, (Wheatley et al, 2019) (Gerstenfeld et al, 2001) (Recknagel et al, 2013) (Hurtgen et al, 2016) (Jiao et al, 2015) and often precedes the excessive bone formation associated with heterotopic ossification and several vertebral column pathological conditions. (Lories & Schett, 2012) (Balboni et al, 2006) Therefore, identifying the key molecular factors triggering the sterile inflammation that precedes regeneration in bone would allow us to modulate the inflammatory reaction in a spatiotemporal and contextual manner as well as to develop new anabolic strategies for the treatment of bone loss conditions, such as osteoporosis, or impaired bone repair.(Roberts & Ke, 2018)'\n",

To investigate a possible involvement of TEs in the sterile inflammatory response triggered by bone injury, we analyzed TEs expression in time-course RNA-Seq repository data obtained from a full-fracture bone healing mice model.(Coates et al, 2019) We focused on TEs expression dynamics immediately after fracture (acute inflammatory stage) and observed four clusters of differentially expressed TEs (logFC > 0.5) between intact and post-fracture bone after 4h, a time point corresponding to the initiation of acute inflammation (Figure 1A). Cluster 1 includes TEs subfamilies whose expression slightly increases after fracture and during the whole healing process. Clusters 2 and 4 include TEs subfamilies that are downregulated after fracture but show increased expression at later time points. The major group, cluster 3, is represented by TEs subfamilies whose expression is highly and transiently upregulated after fracture (Figure 1A and 1B). Interestingly, the induction of these TEs, mostly Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements (LINEs) and Long Terminal Repeats (LTRs) (Figure 1B), is transient and limited to the earliest phase of the inflammatory stage necessary and sufficient to initiate and orchestrate fracture repair and activate bone anabolic processes.(Mountziaris et al, 2011),(Marsell & Einhorn, 2011) These results suggest that, in bone, retrotransposon reactivation is an early event in response to fracture, possibly linked to inflammation initiation which is fundamental for a healthy healing. Indeed, retrotransposon involvement in posttraumatic tissue regeneration was previously found in other organisms.(Mashanov et al, 2012),(Zhu et al, 2012)'\n",

Each cohort was divided into normal (BMD T-score >-1), osteopenic (‚àí2.5 < BMD T-score ‚â§ ‚àí1), and osteoporotic (BMD T-score ‚â§ ‚àí2.5, with at least one fragility fracture). TEs show generally higher upregulation in healthy femurs (n=27) compared to healthy ilia (n=34) (Figure 1C and 1E). Each TEs order showed a high percentage of upregulated subfamilies, from 60% of DNA transposon to 75% of LINEs, and a low percentage of downregulated subfamilies, from 9% of LTRs to 3% of Short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) and LINEs, in femur compared to ilium (Figure 1D).

To further assess whether TEs expression is involved in local anabolism and associated with mineral density, we divided the femur cohort according to the DXA T-score measured in the femoral neck (FN). We divided the cohort into ‚Äúhigh BMD‚Äù (FN T-score >-1) and ‚Äúlow BMD‚Äù (FN T-score <-1). Globally, TEs are upregulated in femurs with high bone mineral density (Figure 2B). In particular, more than 90% of differentially expressed TEs subfamilies are upregulated (Figure 2C). Interestingly, almost all SINE elements are unchanged between the two groups (Figure 2C). Finally, we assessed whether a positive correlation exists between TEs expression levels and local mineral density (FN T-score). We found that approximately 30% of L1 and LTR subfamilies expressed in the femoral bone are positively correlated with local BMD (Figure 2D).

We then corroborated the results by studying the effects of increasing repeat RNA levels on differentiating osteoblasts derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) isolated from femurs of healthy donors. At day 5 of differentiation, a Cy5-conjugated full-length L1 RNA consensus sequence was transfected. Capping, 2‚Äô-O-Methylation of 5‚Äô end, polyadenylation (200 adenosines), full substitution with 5-methylcytidine (m5C) and 75% substitution with pseudouridine were used to stabilize the RNA and to bypass the intracellular innate immune system.(Koski et al, 2004) (Pardi et al, 2013) (Ludwig et al, 2010) (Karik√≥ et al, 2005) (Nallagatla & Bevilacqua, 2008) (Karik√≥ et al, 2008) (Anderson et al, 2010) (Kormann et al, 2011) Red fluorescent protein (RFP) mRNA, with the same modifications, was included as negative control. The exogenous L1 RNA accumulated in the cytoplasm (Figure 3A) and was gradually cleared by secretion along with matrix components (Figure 3B and 3C). The effect of L1 RNA delivery was tested in differentiating MSCs from two different and unrelated healthy donors. As shown, L1 RNA transfection markedly stimulated the production of mineralized matrix (Figure 3D). Osteoblast mineralization increased dose-dependently with the concentration of the delivered L1 RNA, in agreement with saturation kinetics (Figure 3E). Moreover, the strongly enhanced mineralization was highly specific for L1 RNA, as demonstrated by the lack of significant changes in mineral deposition in cells transfected with negative control RNA, even at concentrations 100-200-fold higher (figure 3E). We also isolated MSCs from the femur of osteoporotic patients and selected those showing a markedly delayed and reduced in vitro production of bone matrix in contrast to those derived from healthy donors (Figure 3F). Strikingly, also in these cells with low osteogenic capacity, the delivery of L1 RNA triggered a strong mineralization response despite their clearly compromised anabolic activity (Figure 3G). These results demonstrate convincingly that the ectopic delivery of L1 RNA stimulates the mineralization of bone-forming cells regardless of their prior intrinsic differentiation/anabolic potential.'\n",

Strikingly, although alkaline phosphatase (ALPL) expression slightly increases at later time points (Appendix Figure S1A), its activity is not enhanced in L1-treated cells (Appendix Figure S2A). However, the activity of ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1) is gradually and significantly reduced by L1 RNA transfection (Appendix Figure S2B). As ENPP1 is a major source of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), one of the main physiological inhibitors of mineralization,(FLEISCH et al, 1966) (Johnson et al, 2000) (Hessle et al, 2002) the reduction of its activity may contribute to the enhanced mineralization observed in L1-RNA transfected cells.

We found 482 differentially expressed genes (DEG) (FDR<0.05) between L1 and RFP RNA-treated OB (268 upregulated and 214 downregulated) (Appendix Figure S3). Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed that the early transcriptional signature of L1-treated osteoblasts is typical of that of an inflammatory response (Figure 4A and 4B). This is in accordance with the recent evidence of a link between L1 and other retrotransposons accumulation in the cytoplasm and inflammatory response in vitro and in vivo.(Fukuda et al, 2021) (De Cecco et al, 2019b) (Simon et al, 2019) GO term enrichment analysis comparison between the early stage of fracture-induced bone healing in vivo(Coates et al, 2019) and differentiating osteoblasts in vitro 24h post-L1 delivery (Figure 4A) revealed a matching inflammatory response and shared upregulated pathways (Figure 4C) essential for effective bone repair.(Maruyama et al, 2020) (Gerstenfeld et al, 2003) (Kon et al, 2001) Recruitment of neutrophils at the site of injury also indicates a healthy repair process, particularly in bone.(Kovtun et al, 2016) Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) and 2 (ERK2), play crucial roles in bone formation(Xiao et al, 2000) (Xiao et al, 2002b) (Xiao et al, 2002a) (Matsushita et al, 2009) (Ge et al, 2007) and seem to be the most upstream initiators of tissue regeneration in planaria.(Owlarn et al, 2017) Upon bone injury, an initial transient stage of acute inflammation is a crucial factor in ensuring an effective regeneration(Maruyama et al, 2020) whereas an excessive/prolonged (chronic) inflammation is deleterious for the healing environment.(Chan et al, 2012) (Hurtgen et al, 2016) (Clark et al, 2017) (Brem & Tomic-Canic, 2007) (Timmen et al, 2014) (Schmidt-Bleek et al, 2012) (Weckbach et al, 2013) We followed the time-course expression of ‚Äúinflammatory response‚Äù (GO:0006954) and ‚Äúimmune response‚Äù (GO:0006955) genes upregulated by L1 RNA immediately after transfection. As shown in Figure 4D, their expression is already strongly reduced at day 10 and almost entirely silenced by day 14, suggesting the transient dynamics of the inflammatory response triggered in vitro by L1 RNA. This is coherent with our previous observation that exogenous L1 RNA is gradually secreted by the cell together with matrix components (Figure 3B and C), eventually clearing out the initial inflammatory stimulus.'\n",

Notably, ORF1p was undetectable by WB in differentiating osteoblasts and in L1 transfected osteoblasts (Appendix Figure S5), indicating that the exogenous L1 RNA is not translated after transfection. To assess whether L1-induced inflammation was triggered by the sensing of its cDNA, we used Lamivudine 3TC and G140 (Figure 5A) to inhibit the ORF2-mediated reverse transcription of L1 RNA and cGAS activity, respectively. Moreover, we also performed a siRNA-mediated knockdown (KD) of cGAS (Appendix Figure S6). (Jones et al, 2008) (Lama et al, 2019) Surprisingly, none of the treatments impaired the mineralization induced by L1 RNA delivery (Figure 5A, Appendix Figure S6C), suggesting that the observed cellular response depends entirely on RNA sensing. As previously mentioned, repeats are a major source of endogenous dsRNA,(Sadeq et al, 2021) (Chen & Hur, 2022) and L1 RNA, in particular, is able to form intramolecular double-stranded structures.(Hur, 2019) As expected, we found a tight colocalization between L1 RNA and dsRNA IF signal (Figure 5B). One of the main cellular sensors of dsRNA, including those derived from retrotransposons, is PKR.(Kim et al, 2018) PKR activation results in the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2a (eIF2Œ±) and in the subsequent inhibition of global protein synthesis and cell growth.(Donnelly et al, 2013) Interestingly, PKR has been shown to interact with L1 RNA in vitro.(Kim et al, 2018) Moreover, eIF2Œ± phosphorylation has been demonstrated to promote autophagy in osteoblasts and to counteract BMD reduction in osteoporotic ovariectomized mice.(Li et al, 2019) '\n",

Notably, eIF2Œ± phosphorylation occurs already 6 hours post-transfection. This observation suggests that PKR activation is one of the first events induced by L1 RNA, thus corroborating the hypothesis of PKR as an endogenous L1 RNA sensor.'\n",

Moreover, among the top 15 downregulated biological processes and cellular components were translation and ribosomal subunits (Figure 5D, right panels, yellow circles), indicating that L1 RNA induces a global attenuation of protein synthesis. Indeed, a cap-dependent translation shutdown is the main consequence of eIF2Œ± phosphorylation.(Donnelly et al, 2013) Finally, we show that neither PKR KD (Appendix Figure S6A, B) nor its pharmacological inhibition by C16 treatment (Figure 5E and 5F) prevents L1 RNA-triggered induction of inflammatory genes (Figure 5E) and mineral matrix deposition (Figure 5F, Appendix Figure S6B). As previously mentioned, a global reduction of protein synthesis occurs 24h after L1 transfection and only a little percentage of DEP is upregulated in L1 compared to RFP control (Figure 5D). Interestingly, some of the most upregulated proteins are involved in autophagy and vesicle trafficking (Figure 5G).

We found that the ‚Äúsecretome‚Äù of cells transfected with L1 RNA has a significant paracrine effect on recipient osteoblasts since they showed an earlier formation of mineralized nodules, already 24h post the addition of conditioned media (Figure 6A, right panel), and higher deposition of mineral matrix at day 10 (Figure 6A, left panel). We subsequently isolated bulk and exosome-derived proteomes from conditioned media of untreated, RFP- and L1-treated differentiating osteoblasts and characterized them by MS. Differential expression analysis of MS data revealed a unique secretome profile (for both bulk and vesicular proteomes) of L1-primed osteoblasts compared to RFP-primed and untreated osteoblasts (Figure 6B). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of differentially expressed proteins showed an enrichment of pro-inflammatory factors (i.e. interleukins and chemokines) involved in immune response and chemotactic migration of immune cells (Figure 6C and D), crucial processes for tissue repair mechanisms in vivo. Pro-inflammatory molecules are also a major constituent of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP),(Copp√© et al, 2010) whose transient delivery supports cellular plasticity and tissue regeneration.(Ritschka et al, 2017) Notably, the most enriched protein in L1-specific bulk secretome is interleukin 8 (IL-8), an inflammatory chemokine involved in several regenerative processes, such as skin wound healing,(JIANG et al, 2012) therapeutic angiogenesis after stroke and ischemia,(Choi et al, 2021) (Hou et al, 2014) and osteochondral bone repair.(Lin et al, 2019) (Yang et al, 2018a) Tumor necrosis factor-inducible gene 6 (TSG6) is among the top 10 proteins enriched in the bulk secretome of L1-primed osteoblasts compared to RFP. TSG6 is an inflammatory factor with suggestive therapeutic effects in corneal wounds, myocardial infarction, injured central nervous system, chronic liver damage, and intervertebral disc degeneration.(Zhang et al, 2013) (Lee et al, 2015) (Lee et al, 2009) (Wang et al, 2017) (Yang et al, 2018b) Moreover, TSG6 induces autophagy influx both in vivo and in vitro.(Wang et al, 2017) Another protein positively involved in autophagy and found specifically in the secretome of L1 primed osteoblasts was ATG7 (autophagy-related 7). Osteoblast-specific ATG7 conditional knockout in mice reduced bone mass during developmental and in adult age.(Li et al, 2018) Type 1 lysophosphatidic acid receptor (LPAR1) is also specifically secreted by L1-primed osteoblasts and has proven to be positively involved in bone mineralization in vitro and in vivo.(Alioli et al, 2020) (Gennero et al, 2011)'\n",

Indeed, aside from their role in the nucleus, (Della Valle et al, 2022) (Jachowicz et al, 2017) (Lu et al, 2021) (Percharde et al, 2018) TEs represent a major source of endogenous dsRNA whose role in triggering inflammatory and innate immune responses in various physiological processes has increasingly gained attention.(Sadeq et al, 2021) (Chen & Hur, 2022) For instance, an early acute inflammatory response is of vital importance in initiating and orchestrating bone repair and induce anabolism leading to fracture healing. (Mountziaris et al, 2011) (Marsell & Einhorn, 2011) (Bahney et al, 2019) Moreover, several studies demonstrated a positive effect of proinflammatory mediators on bone mineralization in vitro and in vivo,(Croes et al, 2015) (Croes et al, 2016) (Li et al, 2016) (Croes et al, 2017) indicating that the modulation of inflammatory reaction is a tool to pursue regenerative strategies in bone.(Roberts & Ke, 2018) We found that, in the bone of newly fractured mice, a group of TEs, mostly LINE and LTR, was early, markedly and transiently upregulated. Interestingly, the expression of these TEs was limited to the earliest phase of the inflammatory stage. In line with the hypothesis of a positive correlation between stress-induced bone mineralization and TEs activation, the expression dynamics in human bone biopsies revealed a significant upregulation of TEs in the femur, a bone subjected to high mechanical stresses, high turnover and anabolism, compared to ilium, not weight bearing. Furthermore, we detected a lower TEs expression in donors with compromised bone mineralization and a significant correlation between TEs expression and local BMD. We hypothesized that the expression dynamics of TEs in fracture/mechanical stress observed in vivo could mimic the immunological threshold model of the sterile activation of dsRNA sensors as a response to stressful conditions. Indeed, the transient and controlled breaching of the activation threshold of dsRNA sensors may lead to sterile inflammation being integrated into physiological processes.(Chen & Hur, 2022) To test further this hypothesis, we delivered a full-length L1 consensus sequence as source of dsRNA(Hur, 2019) to differentiating osteoblasts in vitro and showed that L1 RNA initially accumulated in the cytoplasm and is gradually cleared by secretion. The increased cytoplasmic levels of L1 RNA are immediately sensed by PKR, a cytoplasmic dsRNA sensor whose activation induces the phosphorylation of eIF2a(Kim et al, 2018) (Donnelly et al, 2013), leading to the attenuation of global protein synthesis (Donnelly et al, 2013), induction of inflammatory response, and stimulation of mineral matrix deposition. In support of the evidence that PKR is the early sensor of increased L1 RNA cytoplasmic levels, we show that inhibition of PKR activation by C16 prevents L1-induced eIF2a phosphorylation, induction of inflammatory genes, and mineral matrix deposition. Moreover, the inhibition of L1 cDNA formation and sensing by Lamivudine 3TC, G140, or cGAS KD does not affect the L1-induced phenotype. Thus, the evidence does not support that the L1-triggered inflammation is causally connected to a cGAS-STING-dependent sensing of cytosolic L1 cDNA, a mechanism demonstrated operative in senescence.(De Cecco et al, 2019a) '\n",

Although the molecular mechanism behind L1-induced stress response which stimulates the mineralization activity of osteoblasts remains elusive, our results indicate that L1 stimulates the mineral matrix deposition by bone-forming cells regardless of their prior intrinsic anabolic potential. Moreover, MS results suggested that increased autophagy, a process crucial for mineralization and bone homeostasis in vitro and in vivo(Nollet et al, 2014) may contribute to L1-induced hydroxyapatite deposition. Intriguingly, the osteoinductive properties of L1-primed osteoblast-derived secretome and the observation that L1 RNA was gradually secreted by the cells may suggest an involvement of L1 RNA in cell-to-cell communication, in line with the recent finding of other retrotransposons (i.e. ERV) acting as paracrine molecules.(Liu et al, 2021) This, together with the observed L1-dependent induction of CCL and CXCL chemokines and cytokines, being chemoattractants of immune cells and endothelial cells,(Bischoff et al, 2011) (Eash et al, 2010) (Strieter et al, 2005) and the composition of L1-primed osteoblast secretome, makes the in vivo delivery of L1 RNA a necessary step to evaluate its actual contribution to the paracrine processes that orchestrate bone repair mechanisms.

The final libraries were checked using both Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and Agilent Bioanalyzer DNA assay or Caliper (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). Libraries were then prepared for sequencing and sequenced on paired-end 150 bp mode on NovaSeq6000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). RNA-Seq read quality control (QC) analyses and filtering of high-quality reads were executed using FastQC v0.11.9 (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) and BBDuk v35.85 (https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/software-tools/bbtools/bb-tools-user-guide/bbduk-guide/)\\xa0by setting a minimum read length of 35 bp and a minimum Phred-quality score of 25. After trimming quality control, high-quality reads were aligned to the human genome reference (GRCh38) with STAR 2.7.3a,(Dobin et al, 2013) while FeatureCounts 1.6.3 package(Liao et al, 2014) was used to assign reads to genes. Next, lowly expressed genes across one or more experimental conditions were filtered to eliminate the ‚Äúuninformative‚Äù genes using HTSFilter v1.30.1.(Rau et al, 2013) Filtered gene data were further processed with the EdgeR package v3.32.1(Robinson et al, 2010) to normalize (Trimmed Mean of M-7 values, TMM, method) the raw counts and perform differential gene expression analysis. Multiple testing correction was performed with the FDR method(Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995) and significance level was set at FDR < 0.05. Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment was analyzed by performing hypergeometric tests11 for each individual term, and FDR correction was applied (FDR < 0.05). Expression of Interspersed Repeat elements was quantified using SQuiRE 0.9.9.92 (https://github.com/wyang17/SquIRE). SQuiRE provides locus-specific expression quantification along with subfamily-level expression estimates counting unambiguously mapped reads, as well as ambiguously mapped reads using an expectation‚Äìmaximization (EM) algorithm.(Yang et al, 2019) Briefly, reference genome and Repeatmasker annotation were downloaded from UCSC and prepared for the analysis with squire Fetch and squire Clean, respectively. High-quality reads were mapped against the reference genome with STAR using squire Map and expression was quantified using squire Call.

Autophagy adaptors such as optineurin (OPTN) and NDP52 facilitate mitophagy by recruiting the autophagy-initiation machinery, and assisting engulfment of damaged mitochondria through binding to ubiquitinated mitochondrial proteins and autophagosomal ATG8 family proteins. Here, we demonstrate that OPTN and NDP52 form sheet-like phase-separated condensates with liquid-like properties on the surface of ubiquitinated mitochondria. The dynamic and liquid-like nature of OPTN condensates is important for mitophagy activity, because reducing the fluidity of OPTN-ubiquitin condensates suppresses the recruitment of ATG9 vesicles and impairs mitophagy. Based on these results, we propose a dynamic liquid-like, rather than a stoichiometric, model of autophagy adaptors to explain the interactions between autophagic membranes (i.e., ATG9 vesicles and isolation membranes) and mitochondrial membranes during Parkin-mediated mitophagy. This model underscores the importance of liquid-liquid phase separation in facilitating membrane-membrane contacts, likely through the generation of capillary forces.'\n",

      "ele.tag='{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}p' | ele.text='\\tMacroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is an intracellular degradation process mediated by a double-membraned organelle termed the autophagosome . Cytosolic components such as proteins and organelles are segregated into autophagosomes, which subsequently fuse with lysosomes for degradation. Autophagy can be either non-selective or selective . Mitophagy, which is a selective type of autophagy, specifically degrades mitochondria and can be induced by mitochondrial damage or cellular stresses . For example, upon mitochondrial damage, numerous mitochondrial outer-membrane proteins are ubiquitinated by the PINK1-Parkin system, initiating the recruitment of autophagy adaptors, including optineurin (OPTN), calcium binding and coiled-coil domain 2 (CALCOCO2/NDP52), sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1/p62), Next to BRCA1 gene 1 protein (NBR1), and Tax1 binding protein 1 (TAX1BP1) . These autophagy adaptors bridge the mitochondrial and autophagosomal membranes by interacting with mitochondrial ubiquitinated proteins via a ubiquitin-binding domain (UBD) and with autophagosomal ATG8 family proteins (i.e., LC3 and GABARAP family proteins in mammals) via the LC3-interacting region (LIR). In addition to their role in supporting efficient engulfment by autophagosomes, OTPN and NDP52 also play crucial roles in inducing mitophagy by recruiting upstream autophagy factors ; OPTN recruits ATG9 vesicles and TBK1, which subsequently recruits the PI3K complex, whereas NDP52 recruits the ULK1 complex through interaction with FIP200 .'\n",
      "ele.tag='{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}p' | ele.text='\\tLiquid‚Äìliquid phase separation (LLPS) has been described in various biological processes . LLPS involves the formation of liquid-like condensates through dynamic, multivalent interactions between various molecules that often possess intrinsically disordered regions. Emerging evidence suggests connections between autophagy and LLPS at multiple steps, including autophagosome formation and degradation . Notably, autophagy adaptors, such as p62, undergo LLPS through multivalent interaction with poly-ubiquitins and form cytosolic condensates . These condensates can be degraded by autophagy, which is termed ‚Äúfluidophagy‚Äù . Furthermore, recent studies showed that p62 undergoes LLPS on mitochondria and lysosomes that are subjected to selective autophagy .'\n",
      "ele.tag='{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}p' | ele.text='\\tGenerally, phase-separated condensates can deform when they contact a rigid surface in order to minimize the overall energy of the system, a phenomenon known as ‚Äúwetting‚Äù . The wetting behavior of intracellular condensates is determined by the interfacial tensions between the condensate‚Äìmembrane, condensate‚Äìcytosol, and cytosol-membrane interfaces. Depending on the relative strengths of these interfacial tensions, the condensates exhibit partial wetting, complete wetting, or de-wetting. In contrast, elastic surfaces, including membranes to which phase-separated condensates adhere, also deform . This indeed happens during fluidophagy; autophagosomal membranes bend along the surface of p62 condensates . Deformation of a membrane by a phase-separated condensate is determined by the energy balance between membrane deformation and the surface tension of the condensate, which is known as elastocapillarity .'\n",
      "ele.tag='{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}p' | ele.text='\\tBy forming capillary bridges, wetting droplets can also induce adhesion of surfaces . Whether LLPS and capillary bridges also contribute to the adhesion of cellular membranes is not presently known. Therefore, we hypothesized that phase-separated condensates of autophagy adaptors can wet both mitochondria and autophagic membranes, including ATG9 vesicles and isolation membranes (also called phagophores), thereby promoting their contact during Parkin-mediated mitophagy. In this study, we employ live-cell imaging and a mathematical model to provide evidence that the autophagy adaptors form phase-separated condensates on the surface of the mitochondrial membrane, resulting in sheet-like condensates that cover the surface of ubiquitinated mitochondria upon mitophagy induction. These condensates accumulate between mitochondria or between mitochondria and autophagic membranes, exhibiting a dynamic nature with a liquid-like property. Furthermore, we demonstrate the essential role of these dynamic condensates in the recruitment of ATG9 vesicles and the initiation of mitophagy. Based on these results, we propose a dynamic liquid-like model, rather than a stoichiometric model, to describe the roles of autophagy adaptors in Parkin-mediated mitophagy.'\n",

When mitophagy was induced by treatment with the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) in HeLa cells expressing exogenous Parkin, the autophagy adaptors p62, OPTN, NBR1, NDP52, and TAX1BP1 translocated to mitochondria as previously observed (Fig. 1A and B) . Ubiquitin and all of these autophagy adaptors were distributed evenly on the surface of separate mitochondria (Mt; Fig. 1A). In contrast, these adaptors exhibited distinct localization patterns during the formation of isolation membranes on mitochondria (Mt‚ÄìIM; Fig. 1B and C). The signals of OPTN and NDP52 were enriched in areas where LC3B signals colocalized, while they were mostly absent from the LC3B-negative side of the same mitochondria (Fig. 1B and C). Endogenous OPTN and NDP52 also showed clear enrichment on the LC3B-positive areas in comparison to the LC3B-negative side, confirming that this localization is not caused by the overexpression of adaptors (Fig. 1D). However, this inhomogeneous distribution pattern was not observed for ubiquitin, p62, NBR1, and TAX1BP1 (Fig. 1B and C). Unlike OPTN and NDP52, p62 showed enrichment between clustered mitochondria (Mt-Mt), which is consistent with previous reports (Fig. EV1A and B) , which appears to be consistent with the role of p62 in promoting mitochondrial clustering . These accumulation patterns cannot be explained by the stoichiometric interaction of the autophagy adaptors with ubiquitinated proteins that are evenly distributed on mitochondria.'\n",
      "ele.tag='{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}p' | ele.text='\\tThe localization of autophagy adaptors may be affected by their interaction with other adaptors . To examine the localization of each adaptor on its own, we used HeLa cells lacking all five autophagy adaptors (penta KO cells) to exclude the effect of other adaptors . In penta KO cells, OPTN and NDP52 exhibited significant enrichment in LC3B-positive areas, similar to that observed in wild-type cells, suggesting that this accumulation occurred independently of heterologous interaction with other adaptors (Fig. 1E and F). Mitophagy was not restored by exogenous expression of p62 or NBR1 in penta KO cells, and thus colocalization with LC3 could not be tested for these two adaptors . The accumulation of p62 between clustered mitochondria was also observed in penta KO cells (Fig. EV1C and D). Given the uniform distribution of ubiquitinated proteins on mitochondrial surfaces, these data suggest that autophagy adaptors exhibit non-stoichiometric enrichment between membranes. Hereafter, we used penta KO cells to study each autophagy adapter individually.'\n",

We first conducted FRAP experiments for separate (i.e., unclustered) mitochondria in CCCP-treated cells. As expected, ubiquitin showed virtually no recovery because it was conjugated to mitochondrial membrane proteins (Fig. 2A and B). Additionally, p62 recovered only slightly, suggesting a minute exchange between the mitochondrial surface and cytosol (Fig. 2A and B). In contrast, OPTN and NDP52 showed a rapid recovery, indicating a dynamic exchange of these adaptors between the mitochondrial surface and the cytosol (Fig. 2A and B).'\n",

OPTN and NDP52 showed partial recovery (Fig. 2C and D). Although this result indicates some exchange of these adaptors between membranes, the incomplete recovery suggests the existence of a gel-like or immobile fraction. Treatment with 1,6-hexanediol, which can be used to dissolve condensates, dispersed OPTN and NDP52, but not p62, from mitochondria without isolation membranes (Fig. 2E, EV2A). In contrast, 2,5-hexanediol, which is considered by some studies as a negative control for 1,6-hexanediol, did not disperse the OPTN or NDP52 condensates (Fig. EV2B). These data suggest that OPTN and NDP52 accumulation is supported by weak interactions. In contrast, OPTN and NDP52 at the mitochondria-isolation membrane contact sites remained unaffected by 1,6-hexanediol (Fig. EV2C). This may be due to the additional interaction with ATG8 proteins, not only with ubiquitin. These results indicate that OPTN and NDP52 on ubiquitinated mitochondria are mobile and can quickly exchange between the mitochondrial surface and the cytosol, supporting the hypothesis that they form phase-separated condensates on damaged mitochondria.'\n",

The closest distance between the two mitochondrial outer membranes was set to  (Fig. 3A). Here, we considered the dynamics of concentration changes of the adapter proteins and solvent components. We assumed that mitochondria were very large compared with proteins and did not move on a similarly short time scale, and that ubiquitin was tightly bound to mitochondrial membranes and immobile, as suggested by the FRAP experiment (Fig. 2B). The adaptor proteins were assumed to diffuse freely in solution and to bind to ubiquitin and themselves (self-interactions) with strengths  and , respectively.

We then validated these predictions by using live-cell imaging. When two small mitochondria with uniform OPTN distributions on their surface approached each other, OPTN redistributed and formed a smooth surface that covered the two adjacent mitochondria (Fig. 4A‚ÄìD, Movie EV1). Notably, strong OPTN enrichment was observed in the cleft between the two mitochondria (arrowheads, Fig. 4A and C), showing a pattern distinct from that of the outer membrane protein Omp25 (OPTN signal peaks localized outside of Omp25 signal peaks) (Fig. 4B and D). This phenomenon was apparent when the size of both (Fig. 4A) or one (Fig. 4C, Movie EV1) of the two mitochondria was less than 1 ¬µm.

The OPTN-enriched region expanded together with the isolation membrane thereafter (Fig. 4E). These live-cell observations are consistent with the predictions of our mathematical models (Fig. 3).

To achieve this, we utilized the anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) nanobody, which exhibits a high binding affinity to GFP  (Fig. 5A). Consequently, the interaction between anti-GFP nanobody-fused ubiquitin and GFP‚ÄìOPTN was stronger than that between ubiquitin and GFP‚ÄìOPTN (Fig. 5B). Expression of anti-GFP nanobody-fused ubiquitin (nanobody‚ÄìmRuby‚ÄìUb) did not affect the recruitment of GFP‚ÄìOPTN to mitochondria (Fig. 5A, (i) and (ii)) but partially reduced its FRAP recovery (Fig. 5C), suggesting a reduction in mobility. We then evaluated the effect of reduced OPTN fluidity on mitophagy using the recently developed HaloTag cleavage assay . This assay utilizes the ligand-dependent conformational change of HaloTag (Halo); ligand-free Halo is efficiently degraded in lysosomes, whereas ligand-bound Halo becomes resistant to lysosomal degradation. When Halo is expressed in the mitochondrial matrix by fusing to the mitochondrial presequence of Fo-ATPase subunit 9 and SNAP-tag (mtHalo‚ÄìSNAP), we can measure the extent of mitochondrial degradation by quantifying the amount of processed free Halo out of the total amount of Halo (mtHalo‚ÄìSNAP + processed Halo). Mitophagy activity, which was impaired in penta KO cells, was restored by the expression of GFP‚ÄìOPTN (Fig. 5D and E). Mitophagy activity was partially reduced in cells expressing GFP-OPTN and nanobody‚ÄìmRuby‚ÄìUb (Fig. 5D and E). '\n",
      "ele.tag='{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}p' | ele.text='\\tThe partial reduction in both FRAP recovery and mitophagy activity may be attributed to the remaining interaction between OPTN and endogenous ubiquitin. Therefore, we deleted the ubiquitin-binding domain in ABINs and NEMO (UBAN domain) from OPTN (GFP‚ÄìOPTNŒîUBAN), abolishing its interaction with ubiquitinated proteins (Fig. 5B). GFP‚ÄìOPTNŒîUBAN failed to accumulate on mitochondria in the presence of mRuby‚ÄìUb (Fig. 5A, (iii)). In contrast, the expression of nanobody‚ÄìmRuby‚ÄìUb rescued the recruitment of GFP‚ÄìOPTNŒîUBAN to mitochondria (Fig. 5A, (iv)), albeit to a reduced extent, likely reflecting the loss of condensate formation. FRAP experiments revealed that, compared with wild-type GFP‚ÄìOPTN (Fig. 5A, (i)), GFP‚ÄìOPTNŒîUBAN (Fig. 5A, (iv)) showed a substantial decrease in recovery on mitochondria when co-expressed with nanobody‚ÄìmRuby‚ÄìUb, indicating a reduction in its dynamic properties (Fig. 5C). GFP‚ÄìOPTNŒîUBAN failed to restore mitophagy, even when it was co-expressed with nanobody‚ÄìmRuby‚ÄìUb to rescue ubiquitin binding and mitochondrial localization (Fig. 5A, B, D, and E). This impairment was indeed due to the loss of binding to ubiquitin because a point mutation that abolished ubiquitin binding (E478G)  also showed normal mitochondrial localization, low FRAP recovery, and mitophagy defect (Fig. 5D, E, EV4A, and B). Furthermore, the impaired mitophagy was not simply due to the altered binding orientation of OPTN. Replacement of its UBAN domain with GFP (OPTNŒîUBAN‚ÄìGFP), mimicking its binding to ubiquitin at the C-terminus, did not restore FRAP recovery or mitophagy activity, although it also showed clear recruitment to mitochondria in the presence of nanobody‚ÄìmRuby‚ÄìUb (Fig. EV4A, B, C and D). The restricted orientation of OPTN due to the stoichiometric interaction between GFP and nanobody, as opposed to the more flexible orientation in liquid-like condensates, may also contribute to the impairment of autophagy.'\n",

Indeed, ATG9 vesicles are incorporated into condensates containing a glaucoma-associated OPTN mutant  and synapsin . We, therefore, hypothesized that the liquid-like properties of OPTN condensates on mitochondria facilitate the recruitment of ATG9 vesicles.

These findings suggest that phase-separated adaptors facilitate the effective engulfment of mitochondria by the isolation membrane through the wetting effect and capillary forces (Fig. 6E, right panel). Moreover, the fluidity of OPTN condensates is critical for the localization of ATG9 vesicles onto ubiquitinated mitochondria, indicating that partial or complete wetting of phase-separated adaptors to ATG9 vesicles may be crucial for their recruitment to and/or retention on mitochondria (Fig. 6E, left panel). Therefore, we propose that LLPS of autophagy adaptors plays a critical role in two distinct steps of mitophagy by producing capillary forces, first, at the initiation step by recruiting and retaining the ATG9 vesicles in the condensates and, second, at the autophagosome elongation step by facilitating the attachment between ubiquitinated mitochondria and the isolation membrane.

In lysophagy, p62 undergoes LLPS on lysosomes to facilitate efficient lysophagy together with HSP27, which maintains the fluidity of p62 and prevents its gelation . This may also be mediated by the wetting between damaged lysosomes and the isolation membrane by phase-separated p62. Indeed, p62 itself forms phase-separated condensates along with ubiquitinated proteins, producing capillary forces by the wetting effect to facilitate the engulfment by the isolation membrane . In our study, p62 exhibited low mobility, as determined by FRAP and 1,6-hexanediol experiments (Fig. 2B and EV2A). While these data may suggest that p62 is immobile, they appear to contradict the observed redistribution of p62 to the area between mitochondria upon clustering (Fig. EV1A and B). Thus, we speculate that p62 may exhibit some degree of fluidity despite its low exchange between the condensate and cytosol. Similarly to p62, Ape1, the cargo of the cytosol-to-vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway in yeast, forms gel-like condensates with Atg19 on the surface of Ape1 condensates to be sequestered by the isolation membrane . This association could also be mediated by partial wetting.

In this context, ATG8 proteins interact with NIX or BNIP3, likely in a one-to-one manner. This raises the question of why phase separation of autophagy adaptors is essential for Parkin-mediated mitophagy. One possibility is that the quick induction and execution of Parkin-mediated mitophagy requires amplification of the reactions through increased local concentration of adaptors and autophagy-related proteins facilitated by LLPS. This is consistent with the fact that mitophagy-inducing signals are also amplified by a mechanism involving phosphorylated ubiquitin  and OPTN-TBK1 axis . Indeed, we observed that the amount of OPTN recruited to mitochondria was greater with wild-type OPTN than with OPTNŒîUBAN (in the presence of nanobody-Ub), likely reflecting the enhanced recruitment by condensate formation (the reduced recruitment of OPTNŒîUBAN may also be due to a lower expression level of nanobody‚ÄìmRuby‚ÄìUb compared to abundant endogenous ubiquitin, which may further contribute to reduced mitophagy activity) (Fig. 5A and EV4A). Alternatively, Parkin-mediated mitophagy requires a high level of precision and selectivity; mitophagy should be induced only for damaged mitochondria, which is ensured by the recruitment and retention of ATG9 vesicles only on phase-separated adaptor-positive mitochondria. This strict specificity would enable proper quality control of the mitochondria. '\n",

Although Nlgn1 and Nlgn2 are highly homologous and biochemically interact with the same extra- and intracellular proteins, Nlgn1 selectively functions in excitatory synapses whereas Nlgn2 functions in inhibitory synapses. How this excitatory/ inhibitory (E/I) specificity arises is unknown. Using a comprehensive structure-function analysis, we here expressed wild-type and mutant neuroligins in functional rescue experiments in cultured hippocampal neurons lacking all endogenous neuroligins. Electrophysiology confirmed that Nlgn1 and Nlgn2 selectively restored excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, respectively, in neuroligin-deficient neurons, aligned with their synaptic localizations. Chimeric Nlgn1-Nlgn2 constructs reveal that the extracellular neuroligin domains confer synapse specificity, whereas their intracellular sequences are exchangeable. However, the cytoplasmic sequences of Nlgn2, including its Gephyrin-binding motif that is identically present in the Nlgn1, is essential for its synaptic function whereas they are dispensable for Nlgn1. These results demonstrate that although the excitatory vs. inhibitory synapse specificity of Nlgn1 and Nlgn2 are both determined by their extracellular sequences, these neuroligins enable normal synaptic connections via distinct intracellular mechanisms.

In vertebrates, four genes encode Nlgns: Nlgn1, Nlgn2, Nlgn3, and Nlgn4. Among these, Nlgn1, Nlgn2, and Nlgn3 exhibit high conservation across species, while Nlgn4 displays variability between rodents and humans and is expressed at relatively low levels in mice (Bolliger et al, 2008; Ichtchenko et al., 1995; Ichtchenko et al., 1996; Jamain et al, 2003). Nlgns are type 1 transmembrane proteins that comprise a single, large extracellular domain consisting of a constitutively dimeric, enzymatically inactive esterase-homology domain, a transmembrane region (TMR), and a short cytoplasmic tail. Remarkably, the targeting of Nlgns to synapses is selective and specific. Nlgn1 is only localized to glutamatergic synapses (Song et al, 1999) while Nlgn2 is exclusively present at GABAergic, dopaminergic, and cholinergic synapses (Graf et al, 2004; Takacs et al, 2013; Uchigashima et al, 2016; Varoqueaux et al, 2004). Nlgn3 is found in both excitatory and inhibitory synapses (Budreck & Scheiffele, 2007), and Nlgn4 functions in glycinergic synapses in mice and in GABAergic synapses in human neurons (Hoon et al, 2011; Marro et al, 2019; Zhang et al, 2018). Consistent with their localization to synapses, Nlgns perform multiple synapse-specific functions. Compelling initial evidence supporting the synaptic function of Nlgns was obtained through overexpression experiments, which demonstrated significant increases in synapse density and synaptic transmission in transfected neurons (Chubykin et al, 2007; Scheiffele et al, 2000). Since then, a large number of functional studies in invertebrates and vertebrates using both deletions of and mutations in Nlgn genes revealed a panoply of important roles for Nlgns in shaping synapses, confirming the central contribution of Nlgns to the functional architecture of synaptic connections (Banovic et al, 2010; Calahorro & Ruiz-Rubio, 2012; Chubykin et al., 2007; Hu et al, 2012; Hunter et al, 2010; Maglioni et al, 2022; Sudhof, 2008; Sun et al, 2011; Sun et al, 2023; Tabuchi et al, 2007; Tu et al, 2015; Varoqueaux et al, 2006; Xing et al, 2014).'\n",
      "ele.tag='{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}p' | ele.text='Despite much investigation, however, several key questions about Nlgn function remain unaddressed. Possibly the most important of these questions regards the observation that different Nlgn isoforms, despite a high degree of sequence similarity, perform largely non-overlapping distinct functions in the same neurons. How are different Nlgns targeted to distinct synapses where they perform different roles? This question represents an intriguing cell biological challenge given that Nlgns are postsynaptic, and each neuron may receive inputs from thousands of neurons using the whole range of neurotransmitter types. Since Nlgns interact with synapse-specific molecules at both the post-synaptic (on the same cell) and pre-synaptic side (with molecules from the projecting neuron), E/I specificity could be conferred to various Nlgns by intra- and/or extra-cellular mechanisms. For example, Nlgn2 is primarily localized to inhibitory synapses and Nlgn2 loss-of-function results in impaired inhibitory but not excitatory synaptic transmission (Chanda et al, 2017; Chubykin et al., 2007; Gibson et al, 2009; Liang et al, 2015; Poulopoulos et al, 2009; Zhang et al, 2015). Intracellularly, Nlgn2 binds to the inhibitory synapse-specific molecules gephyrin, collybistin, GARLH3, and GARLH4, which are plausible candidates to recruit Nlgn2 to inhibitory synapses (Poulopoulos et al., 2009; Yamasaki et al, 2017). However, the intracellular domains of different Nlgns are highly conserved, which argues against a strong contribution of intracellular interaction partners as a mechanism of E/I specificity. On the extracellular side facing pre-synaptic terminals, several molecules are also known to bind to Nlgns. The best characterized Nlgn interacting proteins are the three Nrxns (Nrxn1-3), each of which is expressed in hundreds of alternatively spliced variants (Treutlein et al, 2014). With this impressive possibility of combinations, it is conceivable that specific \"Nrxn codes\" could decorate different classes of synapses (Aoto et al, 2015; Dai et al, 2019; Dai et al, 2021). More recently, the extracellular MDGA proteins have been described as Nlgn regulators by binding to Nlgns in competition with Nrxns (Connor et al, 2019; Lee et al, 2013; Tanaka et al, 2012). Crystal structures of MDGA1/Nlgn1 and MDGA1/Nlgn2 complexes revealed that two N-terminal lg domains of MDGA1 straddle the Nlgn1 or Nlgn2 homodimer, such that each Nlgn homodimer binds to two MDGA1 molecules (Connor et al, 2016; Gangwar et al, 2017; Kim et al, 2017; Lee et al., 2013). The binding of Nlgns to MDGAs has been hypothesized to restrain Nlgn functions (Elegheert et al, 2017b; Pettem et al, 2013), but much about the mechanisms and relative importance of this interaction is unknown. In summary, how Nlgns target and exert their functions at specific types of synapses remains a mystery.'\n",

Our experimental setup is illustrated in Fig. 1A and entails (i) the generation of primary hippocampal cultures of postnatal day 0 (P0) mice, (ii) the expression by lentiviral transduction of active Cre recombinase or inactive Cre recombinase as a control, and (iii) the co-expression of a specific Nlgn construct.

Co-labeling with excitatory and inhibitory synapse markers allowed us to assess the specific targeting of Nlgn1 and Nlgn2 by fluorescence imaging. We detected strong expression of the infected Nlgn1 and Nlgn2 on MAP2-positive dendrites in a punctate pattern (Fig. 1C-F). We also co-stained HA with Homer1 or Gephyrin as markers of excitatory and inhibitory synapses, respectively (Fig. 1C and 1E). Consistent with reports about endogenous Nlgn1 and Nlgn2 (Song et al., 1999; Varoqueaux et al., 2004), we found that in the absence of endogenous Nlgns, the majority of HA-Nlgn1 puncta were co-localized with Homer1, representing ~60% of the observed puncta. In contrast, HA-Nlgn1 puncta showed little co-localization with Gephyrin, accounting for only ~27% of the observed puncta. HA-Nlgn2 puncta, conversely, predominantly co-localized with Gephyrin, with ~59% of the puncta showing this co-localization. Only ~28% of HA-Nlgn2 puncta co-localized with Homer1 (Fig. 1D and F). We also analyzed the colocalization of Homer1 and Gephyrin to address synapse specificity at the confocal level. We found ~21% Homer1 co-localization with Gephyrin and ~30% Gephyrin co-localization with Homer1 (Fig. EV1C and D). However, the background of positive colocalization with the 'wrong' synapse is high due to the insufficient imaging resolution for separating closely spaced synapses and the significant impact of thresholding on apparent colocalizations. Although these findings are limited by the resolution of confocal microscopy, they are consistent with previous conclusions that Nlgn1 primarily targets excitatory synapses while Nlgn2 primarily targets inhibitory synapses, showing that Nlgn1 and Nlgn2 exhibit this specificity even in the absence of other Nlgns.\"\n",

We then expressed the constructs in our Nlgn1234 cKO hippocampal neuron system. Cell surface staining of Nlgn2-GPI and Nlgn2-Nlgn1 constructs in the Cre-infected neurons confirmed proper surface localization, indicating that the introduced mutations do not interfere with protein synthesis and processing in the secretory pathway (Fig. EV2A). Remarkably, co-labeling with antibodies against the inhibitory synapse protein Gephyrin revealed that both constructs localized to inhibitory synapses, but Nlgn2-Nlgn1 exhibited a higher degree of localization with Gephyrin compared to Nlgn2-GPI (Fig. EV2B), and expression levels no significant change (Fig. EV2C).'\n",

Expression of full-length Nlgn2 resulted in a full rescue of the GABAR-mediated IPSCs, demonstrating that Nlgn2 is the main Nlgn isoform responsible for the inhibitory synapse phenotype observed with Ngln1234 deletions (Fig. 2B and C). Intriguingly, expression of Nlgn2-GPI, i.e. Nlgn2 without an intracellular domain, failed to rescue the phenotype (Fig. 2B and C), revealing that Nlgn2 function for inhibitory synapses requires an intracellular domain presumably due to the absence of synaptic targeting motifs in the GPI-anchor domain and the impact of membrane anchoring on protein trafficking and synaptic recruitment. Given the sequence similarity between the intracellular domains of Nlgns despite their different synaptic functions, we assessed the function of a chimeric Nlgn2 with an intracellular domain of Nlgn1. Consistent with previous results (Nguyen et al, 2016), the Nlgn2-Nlgn1 construct could also rescue the GABAR-mediated IPSC phenotype in Nlgn1234 cKO neurons (Fig. 2B and C).

This raised the question whether the Gephyrin-binding sequence is responsible for the Nlgn1 and Nlgn2 intracellular domain rescue of Nlgn2 function. To address this question, we deleted the entire 15 amino acid-long Gephyrin-binding sequence from the Nlgn2-Nlgn1 construct or introduced the Y770A point mutation which was shown to prevent Nlgn2 binding to Gephyrin by blocking the phosphorylation of this residue (Giannone et al, 2013; Poulopoulos et al., 2009) (Fig. 3B). Unexpectedly, expression of Nlgn2-Nlgn1Y770A construct fully rescued the IPSC phenotype, whereas the construct with the deletion of the entire Gephyrin-binding sequence (Nlgn2-Nlgn1 DelGeph) did not rescue (Fig. 3C and D). Again, we confirmed that the expressed constructs are properly transported to the cell surface by neuronal surface staining (Fig. EV2D). In line with our electrophysiology data, co-labeling with Gephyrin antibodies showed that the Nlgn2-Nlgn1 Y770A mutant displayed a greater degree of co-localization with Gephyrin than the Nlgn2-Nlgn1DelGeph mutant (Fig. EV2E), and expression levels no significant change (Fig. EV2F).These data show that the Gephyrin-binding sequence is critical for proper Nlgn2 function in inhibitory synapses but that either the interaction of Nlgn2 with Gephyrin alone may not be functionally necessary or that the Gephyrin interaction mediated by Y770 phosphorylation may be less relevant in a cellular context than in vitro.'\n",

To interrogate whether the interaction of MDGAs with the extracellular domain of Nlgn2 confers synaptic specificity, we generated a Nlgn2 mutant (Nlgn2-MDGA1mt) containing three point mutations H278A, D362K, E372K that were previously shown to interfere with MDGA1 binding (Fig. 5D) (Gangwar et al., 2017). The Nlgn2-MDGA1mt construct properly localized to the neuronal surface and co-localized with Gephyrin puncta (Fig. EV2A and B). In line with these findings, functional rescue experiments revealed that the Nlgn2-MDGA1mt construct fully retained the ability of Nlgn2 to rescue the IPSC impairment of Nlgn1234 cKO neurons (Fig. 5E and F). These data suggest that MDGA1 does not directly suppress the inhibitory function of Nlgn2 in synapses. This finding is consistent with recent work showing that MDGA1 targets APP, but not Nlgn2, in hippocampal CA1 GABAergic neural circuits (Kim et al, 2022).'\n",

Consistent with a lack of importance of the intracellular Nlgn1 domain, a Nlgn2-Nlgn1 construct was unable to rescue the glutamatergic synaptic phenotype (Fig. 6B-D). Importantly, we confirmed the surface expression Nlgn1-GPI and Nlgn2-Nlgn1. Co-localization of the constructs with Homer1 revealed that a larger fraction of Nlgn1-GPI, and a smaller fraction of Nlgn2-Nlgn1 were co-localized with Homer1 (Fig. EV4A and B), and expression levels no significant change (Fig. EV4C). We also found Nlgn1-Nlgn2 is sufficient for the glutamatergic synaptic transmission function of Nlgn1, but Nlgn2-WT doesn‚Äôt (Fig. EV5).

In this study, we sought to investigate the mechanisms that confer this intriguing synapse specificity onto Nlgn1 and Nlgn2 and to understand how two closely related proteins can possess such contrasting functions. To eliminate the potentially confounding effects of other Nlgns that may heterodimerize with exogenously expressed Nlgns or otherwise influence a specific Nlgn under investigation, we here resorted to a reductionistic approach that employs a primary neuronal culture system lacking endogenous Nlgns. Specifically, we used as a general substrate of functional analyses neurons that lack all four Nlgns, in which we then expressed a specific Nlgn mutant. Surprisingly, we found that different molecular mechanisms guide Nlgn1 and Nlgn2 function in this system. Our results allow us to draw five main conclusions.'\n",
      "ele.tag='{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}p' | ele.text='First, deletion of all four Nlgns results in a major dysfunction of both GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses, demonstrating that neuronal Nlgns are crucial for proper synaptic transmission. These results are consistent with previous findings using Nlgn123 cKO and Nlgn1234 cKO mice (Chanda et al., 2017; Gan & Sudhof, 2020). Our findings further corroborate the notion that Nlgn1 is important for glutamatergic and Nlgn2 for GABAergic neurotransmission since Nlgn1 could selectively rescue the glutamatergic defect and Nlgn2 the GABAergic defect of Nlgn1234 cKO neurons. Moreover, Nlgn1 molecules were primarily targeted to Homer1-positive excitatory synapses and Nlgn2 to Gephyrin-positive inhibitory synapses.'\n",
      "ele.tag='{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}p' | ele.text='Second, Nlgn2‚Äôs function at inhibitory synapses requires its intracellular domain. Given this finding, interactions mediated by the intracellular domain would represent an attractive mechanism to target Nlgn2 to GABAergic synapses given the many inhibitory synapse-specific scaffolding proteins that are known to bind to the Nlgn2 cytoplasmatic domain (Poulopoulos et al., 2009; Tyagarajan et al, 2011). Unexpectedly, however, the Nlgn2 intracellular domain was unable to confer onto Nlgn2 its GABAergic synapse specificity since the Nlgn1 intracellular domain was fully capable of substituting for the Nlgn2 intracellular domain. A conspicuous similarity between Nlgn1 and Nlgn2 is the Gephyrin-binding sequence that is equally present in the Nlgn1 and Nlgn2 cytoplasmic domain despite the fact that Nlgn1 exclusively functions in excitatory synapses lacking Gephyrin. Gephyrin is a key postsynaptic scaffolding protein at GABAergic synapses that enables the recruitment of GABAA receptors to synapses (Choii & Ko, 2015; Tyagarajan & Fritschy, 2014). Importantly, we found that the Gephyrin-interacting domain is necessary for Nlgn2 function, suggesting that recruitment by Gephyrin is indeed important. However, Gephyrin may not be the only important Nlgn2 binding partner. A Nlgn2 variant that carries the Y770A mutation, previously shown to disrupt Gephyrin binding (Giannone et al., 2013; Poulopoulos et al., 2009), was still fully functional. This finding suggests that potentially other co-factors may stabilize the Gephyrin-Nlgn2 interaction overcoming the Y770A mutation. A previous study also showed an only partial functional impairment of Nlgn2 by the Y770A mutation (Nguyen et al., 2016). However, in this paper the deletion of the entire Gephyrin binding sequence also only partly impaired Nlgn2 function whereas in our experiments such a deletion was functional deleterious. Overall, these results prompted us to look for additional cytosolic Nlgn2 sequences that are important for Nlgn2 function. Through targeted mutagenesis, we identified a new sequence of 21-residue that is just as critical as the better characterized Gephyrin-binding sequence and may represent a binding surface for additional postsynaptic proteins at GABAergic synapses. Of note, the two amino acid residues K749 and R750 were shown to be ubiquitinated and methylated, respectively (Guo et al, 2014; Wagner et al, 2012). '\n",
      "ele.tag='{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}p' | ele.text='Third, we found that different Nlgns use distinct functional mechanisms at their target synapses. Whereas Nlgn2 requires its intracellular domain for enabling inhibitory synaptic connections, Nlgn1 -consistent with previous results (Jiang et al, 2017; Wu et al, 2019)- does not. This may be our conceptually most intriguing result: Despite the fact that Nlgn1 and Nlgn2 are both enabling synapse function, albeit at different types of synapses, their mechanisms of action differ critically. '\n",
      "ele.tag='{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}p' | ele.text='Fourth, the extracellular but not the intracellular domain of Nlgn1 and Nlgn2 determines their specificity for glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses, respectively. The Intracellular domain of Nlgn2 (but intriguingly not of Nlgn1) is necessary for synaptic localization and its \"specific\" recruitment to synapses. Chimeric Nlgn2-Nlgn1 molecules enabled GABAergic synaptic transmission, but not glutamatergic, while chimeric Nlgn1-Nlgn2 molecules mediated glutamatergic, but not GABAergic synaptic transmission. The specificity for glutamatergic vs. GABAergic synapses is dictated by the Nlgn1, and Nlgn2 extracellular domains, respectively. Nrxns are well-studied pre-synaptic binding partners of Nlgns and thus could provide synapse specificity. However, we found that Nlgn1 variants unable to bind Nrxns still rescued the excitatory phenotypes as reported previously (Ichtchenko et al., 1995; Ichtchenko et al., 1996; Jiang et al., 2017; Ko et al., 2009; Sudhof, 2017; Wu et al., 2019). These results suggest that Nlgns function via interactions with other binding partners in addition to Nrxns. Indeed, recently MDGA proteins have been identified as Nlgn interaction partners, binding through their lg1-lg2 domains to the lobes of the Nlgn extracellular dimer at sites overlapping with the Nrxn binding interface (Elegheert et al, 2017a; Gangwar et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2017). They thus emerge as candidates that may provide synapse specificity for Nlgns. Remarkably, however, we found that mutant Nlgn1 predicted to lack MDGA binding was fully able to rescue Nlgn1 function, indicating that this class of interaction is also not providing specificity. Additionally, in vivo experiments show that MDGA1 targets APP, but not Nlgn2, in hippocampal CA1 GABAergic neural circuits to regulate GABAergic synaptic transmission (Kim et al., 2022). In addition to MDGAs, at least Nlgn3 has been shown to bind to PTPRD (Yoshida et al, 2021), which in turn binds to neurexins (Han et al, 2018), suggesting a possible synapse maintenance mechanism involving multiple trans-synaptic interactions.'\n",
      "ele.tag='{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}p' | ele.text=\"Finally, we conclude that Nlgn1 may be acting as a monomer in regulating synaptic transmission and that no binding event that involves signal transduction mediated by dimerization plays a role in Nlgn1's specificity. Mutations disrupting Nlgn1 dimerization did not impair Nlgn1 function in our hippocampal cell assay. Intriguingly, a previous study showed that Nlgn1 overexpression enhances both NMDAR- and AMPAR- EPSCs in neurons, even when dimerization is disrupted (Ko et al., 2009). \"\n",

With the conclusion that extracellular mechanisms must be responsible for functional specificity of Nlgns, but neither Nrxn nor MDGA interactions are themselves sufficient to account for the specificity of Nlgns, there must be other thus-far unidentified proteins present at excitatory and inhibitory pre-synaptic compartments that interact with Nlgns. In the case of Nlgn2, the intracellular domain is critical for synaptic function, but its exact role continues to be unclear. For example, Nlgn2 activation by an extracellular signal could stimulate a defined signal-transduction cascade, akin to a conventional receptor/ligand-induced signaling pathway. Unraveling these signaling mechanisms will contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the molecular pathways governing Nlgn-mediated synaptic processes. These questions are crucial for a general understanding of the diversity of Nlgns functions. Detailed molecular, genetic, and biochemical approaches may lead to a better insight into these questions.

The H3K4me2/3 histone demethylase KDM5C has been shown to regulate transcription. The diverse roles of KDM5C are likely determined by its interacting partners, which are still largely unknown. In this study, we screen for KDM5C-binding proteins and show that YY1 interacts with KDM5C. A synergistic antitumor effect is exerted when both KDM5C and YY1 are depleted, and targeting YY1 appears to be a vulnerability in KDM5C-deficient cancer cells. Mechanistically, KDM5C promotes global YY1 chromatin recruitment, especially at promoters. Moreover, an intact KDM5C JmjC domain but not KDM5C histone demethylase activity is required for KDM5C-mediated YY1 chromatin binding. Transcriptional profiling reveals that dual inhibition of KDM5C and YY1 increases transcriptional repression of cell cycle- and apoptosis-related genes. In summary, our work demonstrates a synthetic lethal interaction between YY1 and KDM5C and suggests combination therapies for cancer treatments.'\n",

In addition, numerous studies have shown that aberrant epigenetic alterations contribute to cancer therapeutic resistance(Hogg et al, 2020; Miranda Furtado et al, 2019; Zafar et al, 2021). Therefore, targeting epigenetic regulators is an attractive strategy for cancer therapy.'\n",

By specifically removing one or two methyl groups from Lys4 in histone H3, the dynamic balance in histone H3K4 methylation is maintained. KDM5C carries a composite catalytic region in which JmjN and JmjC domains are located. JmjC is critical for catalyzing the demethylation of H3K4me2/3, while the JmjN domain interacts with the JmjC domain for the complete catalytic function of KDM5C. H514 is a highly conserved amino acid that is located in the catalytic core of the JmjC domain, and its mutation eliminates KDM5C demethylase activity. KDM5C can suppress transcription by reducing the level of H3K4me2/3 via its demethylase activity; however, whether modulation of H3K4 methylation status is the only mechanism or the predominant mechanism by which KDM5C regulates gene expression is unclear.'\n",
      "ele.tag='{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}p' | ele.text='KDM5C is frequently mutated or aberrantly expressed in various cancer types. Several studies have indicated that KDM5C is involved in regulating different biological processes in tumor cells through its histone demethylase activity and functions as a tumor suppressor. For example, the high-risk HPV E6 protein degrades KDM5C in cervical cancer cells, which results in super enhancers activation of the proto-oncogenes c-MET and EGFR by changing the H3K4me3/H3K4me1 ratio(Chen et al, 2018). In clear cell renal cell carcinoma cells, KDM5C inhibits the expression of genes related to glycogen metabolism by reducing H3K4me3 levels at the promoters of these genes, while inactivating KDM5C mutation confers cell resistance to ferroptosis(Zheng et al, 2021). However, the therapeutic strategy for KDM5C-deficient tumors is unknown. Intriguingly, KDM5C has also been shown to promote tumorigenesis, although the exact mechanism is unclear; in general, these observations suggest that KDM5C potentially regulates gene expression via a distinct mechanism.'\n",

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by next generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis with multiple engineered cell lines revealed that KDM5C is essential for YY1 chromatin recruitment, which is partially dependent on an intact JmjC domain in KDM5C. Simultaneous loss of KDM5C and YY1 led to significantly enhanced transcriptional inhibition of a number of essential cell fate genes, elevated the apoptosis rate and led to cell cycle arrest.

Indeed, a systemic The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) clinical data-based analysis clearly revealed that high KDM5C expression was positively or negatively correlated with cancer patient survival, depending on the cancer type (Figure 1A), reinforcing the idea that KDM5C may exhibit a distinct regulatory effect on gene expression, prompting us to screen the interacting partners of KDM5C. Tandem affinity purification (TAP) was subsequently performed. We generated a HEK293T cell line that stably expressed SBP- and Flag-tagged KDM5C, and the lysates of these cells were incubated with streptavidin-coated beads. The bead-bound proteins were subsequently eluted with buffer containing biotin. Next, the captured proteins were incubated with anti-Flag beads, and the proteins bound to these beads were eluted and analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). The results of the MS analysis indicated that a number of proteins potentially interact with KDM5C, including YY1 (Figure 1B), the overexpression of which has been observed in the vast majority of cancers(Gao et al, 2019; van Leenders et al, 2007). Given the pivotal role played by YY1 in the transcriptional regulation of numerous genes(Meliala et al, 2020), we focused on the interaction between KDM5C and YY1. To confirm their interaction, mutual coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays were performed in HEK293T cells, and the results clearly showed that KDM5C bound to YY1 (Figure 1C). Co-IP with endogenous proteins was also performed and the results confirmed that KDM5C interacts with YY1 in mammalian cells (Figure 1D). In addition, we also performed the semi-endogenous co-IP with YY1 and KDM5C-Flag in 769-P renal cancer cell lines. As shown in Figure 1E, KDM5C clearly bound to YY1. To delineate the interaction, a series of KDM5C truncation mutants were constructed and used for further analysis (Figure 1F). We found that multiple regions, including the JmjN and JmjC domains, which are critical for H3K4me2/3 removal, were also involved in the interaction between KDM5C and YY1 (Figure 1G).'\n",

YY1 tethers cofactors and promotes or represses transcription, depending on its interacting partner, which includes c-myc and p53(Shrivastava et al, 1993; Sui et al, 2004), prompting us to investigate the role of the YY1 KDM5C interaction in tumorigenesis. To achieve this goal, we first selected human kidney proximal tubular epithelial cell line (HK-2), and several renal cancer cell lines (ACHN, 769-P and RCC4) with different KDM5C and YY1 protein expression levels, as described in our previous studies(Chen et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2021) (Figure 2A). Interestingly, knocking down YY1 in KDM5C-deficient RCC4 tumor cells significantly reduced the colony formation ability of the cells, which was not observed in the KDM5C-proficient tumor cell lines ACHN and 769-P (Figure 2B and EV1B-D). Similar results were also obtained in a CCK8-based tumor cell proliferation assay (Figure 2C and EV1E-F). Notably, tumor growth was markedly inhibited when both of KDM5C and YY1 were depleted, whereas the loss of either KDM5C or YY1 only negligibly influenced ACHN cell growth (Figure 2D). These results strongly indicate that KDM5C might be important for YY1-related tumorigenesis, suggesting that YY1 may be a vulnerable target in KDM5C-deficient tumor cells.'\n",

Given that YY1 always promotes tumorigenesis by increasing oncogene transcription, it is unlikely that YY1 tethers KDM5C because KDM5C has H3K4me2/3 demethylase activity, which is associated with repressed gene expression. A recent study revealed that KDM5B, which is a member of the KDM5 demethylase family, recruited a methyltransferase to suppress antitumor immunity, prompting us to explore whether KDM5C has a scaffolding function similar to that of KDM5B(Zhang et al, 2021). We generated a stable KDM5C-depleted ACHN cell lines (Figure EV1B), and ChIP-seq assays were subsequently performed. As shown in Figure 3A, the intensity of the YY1 binding peak was reduced upon loss of KDM5C, implying that KDM5C might be a general regulator of YY1 activity by mediating its chromatin recruitment. Next, we asked to what extent KDM5C co-localizes with YY1. To evaluate the genomic co-occupancy of KDM5C and YY1, we performed the cleavage under targets and tagmentation (CUT&Tag) assay in the ACHN renal cell line, and the annotation of the YY1 and KDM5C peaks revealed an obvious overlap (n=3645) between YY1 and KDM5C binding events (Figure 3B). Further analyzed revealed a significant overlap, with 7,957 genes being concurrently bound by both YY1 and KDM5C (Hypergeometric test, P=4.87e-17). This overlap accounts for 56.32% of the total genes bound by KDM5C and 66.71% of the total genes bound by YY1. Moreover, a heatmap and a metaplot analysis revealed that the enrichment of YY1 was reduced after KDM5C was depleted in the peaks (n=3645) where YY1 and KDM5C were directly related (Figure 3C). Reduced enrichment of YY1 was also observed in HK-2 cells with KDM5C depletion (Figure EV1A and EV2A). These results revealed that the intensity of the YY1 binding peaks was partially dependent on the KDM5C protein level in both nontumoral cell and tumor cells, suggesting that KDM5C mediated YY1 chromatin recruitment may represent a universal mechanism of action. The localization of the KDM5C-dependent YY1 binding peaks was subsequently analyzed, and the results revealed that most of the peaks were enriched in promoters (Figure 3D), implying that KDM5C may regulate gene expression via a distinct mechanism.'\n",

As shown in Figure 4A, ectopic KDM5C WT but not the KDM5C-H514A mutant enhanced YY1 chromatin binding. A similar trend was also observed in HK-2 cells (Figure EV2A). Because the primary function of KDM5C is to catalyze the removal of methyl groups from H3K4me2/3, we evaluated whether H3K4me3 abundance plays a role in YY1 recruitment.'\n",

Increased H3K4me3 enrichment was clearly observed in the KDM5C/YY1 overlapping region (Figure 4B), but the opposite trend of YY1 recruitment was observed in KDM5C-depleted cells (Figure 3C). To further understand the relationship between YY1 recruitment and H3K4me3, we focused on the overlapping regions of YY1 and H3K4me3 (n=11087), which were classified into KDM5C demethylase-dependent peaks (n=9943) and KDM5C demethylase-independent peaks (n=1144), as shown in Figure 4C. Reduced YY1 ChIP-seq signals were observed in almost all of the overlapping YY1 and H3K4me3 regions (Figure 4D-E), regardless of the effect of KDM5C on H3K4me3 intensity. We therefore hypothesized that an intact KDM5C JmjC domain, rather than KDM5C histone demethylase activity, is essential for YY1 recruitment.'\n",
      "ele.tag='{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}p' | ele.text='To further explore the mechanism underlying the effects of KDM5C, we evaluated the interaction between KDM5C-H514A and YY1 and found that the mutation did not influence their interaction (Figure EV3), indicating that the effect of KDM5C-H514A on YY1 chromatin recruitment was unlikely to be caused by disrupted protein binding activity. Because the catalytic composite JmjN/C domain binds the substrate H3 tail harboring methylated H3K4 and since a previous study revealed that none of the KDM5C PHD domains exhibited strong binding affinity for unmethylated or methylated histones(Iwase et al, 2007), we speculated that the replacement of the histidine residue at position 514 with an alanine residue destroyed the integrity of the JmjN/C domain and influenced the chromatin-binding activity of KDM5C. To test this hypothesis, we expressed KDM5C-WT or KDM5C-H514A in HEK293T cells and isolated chromatin-bound proteins. Interestingly, although the protein levels in whole-cell lysates were indistinguishable, H154A exhibited obviously reduced chromatin-binding capacity (Figure 4F), which might help explain why KDM5C-H514A failed to recruit YY1 to chromatin. In addition, tumor cell proliferation was markedly inhibited only when both of KDM5C and YY1 were depleted in the KDM5C-proficient tumor cells ACHN and 769-P (Figure 4G-H and EV1B-C). The inhibitory effect was blunted when KDM5C-WT was re-expressed; in contrast, KDM5C-H514A only moderately restored the growth of ACHN and 769-P double knockdown cells. A similar trend was also observed in the colony formation assay (Figure 4J). In KDM5C-deficient RCC4, cells overexpression of KDM5C-WT largely restored cell sensitivity to YY1 depletion (Figure 4I and EV1D). These result collectively suggest that an intact catalytic domain of KDM5C is required for YY1 recruitment.'\n",

In contrast, the simultaneous loss of KDM5C and YY1 resulted in altered transcription of thousands of genes (1511 genes whose expression was downregulated versus 797 genes whose expression was upregulated, |log2FC|‚â•1.5, p value<0.05, Figure 5C), indicating that YY1 recruitment by KDM5C likely contributed to gene expression activation.

These results strongly suggest that KDM5C increases the expression of essential cell-fate genes by recruiting YY1 to their promoters. '\n",

To confirm the synergistic effect of KDM5C and YY1 on tumorigenicity and cancer cell proliferation, we analyzed the cell cycle progression and apoptosis rate of tumor cells in which KDM5C, YY1 or both had been depleted. We first measured the ratio of renal cancer cells in each phase of the cell cycle, and the results indicated that the loss of both KDM5C and YY1 caused an increased ratio of 769-P tumor cells arrested in the G2/M phase. Similar results were also observed in KDM5C-deficient RCC4 cells after YY1 depletion (Figure 6A). Moreover, double knockdown of KDM5C and YY1 but not loss of either gene individually greatly increased the percentage of apoptotic cells in 769-P tumors. In addition, the absence of YY1 in RCC4 cells induced a significant increase in the percentage of apoptosis cells (Figure 6B). These results confirmed the inhibitory effect of YY1 depletion on KDM5C-deficient cells (Figure 4). Taken together, our study revealed a synergistic regulatory effect of KDM5C and YY1 on cancer cell proliferation and cell cycle progression.'\n",

      "ele.tag='{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}p' | ele.text='As a member of the GLI-Kruppel family of zinc finger DNA-binding proteins, YY1 has been proven to regulate genes either by directly binding to a promoter or indirectly by associating with chromatin-remodeling proteins or histone modifiers (Gordon et al, 2006; Khachigian, 2018). YY1 is frequently overexpressed in many cancer types and reshapes the oncogenic gene expression network(Bonavida & Kaufhold, 2015; Sarvagalla et al, 2019). Although YY1 can directly bind to a promoter DNA sequence, the mechanism underlying its recruitment to chromatin is still not fully understood. In addition, although targeting YY1 might be an attractive therapeutic strategy, a robust biomarker to analyze its effect is lacking. In this study, we found that YY1 is a KDM5C-associated protein, and the JmjC domain of KDM5C was essential for the KDM5C‚ÄìYY1 interaction. Moreover, we demonstrated that KDM5C mediates the chromatin recruitment of YY1, which is important for YY1 binding to promoter regions and the transcription of cell fate-related genes. Importantly, targeting YY1 effectively inhibited the proliferation and tumorigenicity of tumor cells with low KDM5C expression. Considering these findings, we propose the following model: YY1 chromatin recruitment is at least partially dependent on the presence of KDM5C, and in tumor cells with high KDM5C expression, a small amount of YY1 can be recruited to chromatin even after KDM5C is knocked down. In contrast, depleting YY1 in low KDM5C-expressing tumor cells completely eliminated chromatin-bound YY1 and promoted tumor regression (Figure 7).'\n",
      "ele.tag='{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}p' | ele.text='As a specific H3K4 histone demethylase, KDM5C plays dual roles as both a proto-oncogene and tumor suppressor(Chen et al., 2018; Ji et al, 2015; Shen et al, 2016; Shen et al, 2021). KDM5C interacts with specific transcription factors, such as MYC(Outchkourov et al, 2013; Secombe et al, 2007), and downregulates gene expression by reducing H3K4me2/3 levels at enhancer or promoter regions. However, studies, including our previous reports, have shown that KDM5C also upregulates the expression of certain genes, but the relevant molecular mechanism of KDM5C effect on gene expression is unclear(Outchkourov et al., 2013; Scandaglia et al, 2017; Zheng et al., 2021). A recent study showed that the histone demethylase KDM5B recruited the H3K9 methyltransferase SETDB1 to suppress antitumor immunity in a KDM5B demethylase-independent manner, implying that the scaffolding function of this epigenetic regulator was important in certain contexts, a finding that has been appreciated to a lesser degree in prior studies(Zhang et al., 2021). Our finding that KDM5C recruited YY1 to chromatin in a histone demethylase-independent manner reinforces the evidence suggesting that the scaffolding function of epigenetic regulators might be critical for tumorigenesis. Indeed, epigenetic inhibitors targeting the catalytic domain often show limited efficacy and intolerable toxicity, and our findings strongly suggest that targeting the scaffolding function should be considered in the development of new cancer prevention strategies and therapies.'\n",

Therefore, epigenome-based therapies might be developed to block the dysregulated expression of proto-oncogenes in tumor cells and increase antitumor responses(Miranda Furtado et al., 2019; Nebbioso et al, 2018). KDM5C has been shown to be frequently mutated or aberrantly expressed in various cancers. The degree of YY1 chromatin recruitment was decreased in KDM5C-deficient tumor cells, and further inhibition of YY1 expression might completely suppress YY1-directed transcription and significantly impair the proliferation of tumor cells. Furthermore, simultaneously targeting KDM5C and YY1 effectively inhibited tumor growth in KDM5C-proficient tumor cells. In recent years, the induction of synthetic lethality has been applied to the identification of novel drug targets, opening new avenues to tumor-targeted therapy(Nijman & Friend, 2013). Considering the definition of synthetic lethality and the results presented here, we propose that KDM5C and YY1 form a synthetically lethal gene pair, providing a rationale for the clinical treatment of patients with KDM5C-deficient cancer by targeting YY1.'\n",

Here we present transcriptional profiling of HER2+ breast cancer cells transitioning from dormant drug tolerant cells to re-proliferating cells under continuous HER2 inhibitor (HER2i) therapy. Focusing on phosphatases, expression of dual-specificity phosphatase DUSP6 was found inhibited in dormant cells, but strongly induced upon re-growth. DUSP6 expression also selectively associated with poor patient survival in HER2+ breast cancers. DUSP6 overexpression conferred apoptosis resistance, whereas its pharmacological blockade prevented therapy tolerance development under HER2i therapy. DUSP6 targeting also synergized with clinically used HER2i combination therapies. Mechanistically DUSP6 is a positive  regulator of HER3 expression, and its impact on HER2i tolerance was mediated by neuregulin-HER3 axis. In vivo, genetic targeting of DUSP6 reduced tumor growth in brain metastasis model, whereas its pharmacological targeting induced synthetic lethal therapeutic effect in combination with HER2i. Collectively this work demonstrates that DUSP6 drives escape from HER2i-induced dormancy, and that DUSP6 is a druggable target to overcome HER3-driven TKI resistance. '\n",

These different phases were originally demonstrated for EGFR-targeted therapies in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells (Sharma et al, 2010), but the concept has been expanded more recently to other malignancies including HER2+ breast cancer (Chang et al, 2022; De Conti et al., 2021; Dhimolea et al, 2021; Hata et al., 2016; Kurppa et al, 2020; Sharma et al., 2010). Based on these studies, there is ample of omics data from dormant cells (also called as drug tolerant persisters; DTPs) from different cancer types treated with variety of therapies. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind the regrowth of DTPs under continuous therapy is still rudimentary. Especially, to our knowledge there are no published studies describing transcriptional landscapes of transition from DTP to drug tolerant expanding cells (DTEP), or transition of DTEP cells to long term resistant (LR) cells upon TKI therapies.

HER2 belongs to the ERBB family of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) with four members: HER1 (EGFR), HER2, HER3 and HER4. Upon ligand binding, the ERBB receptors homo-and heterodimerize and activate downstream signaling pathways including PI3K/AKT and RAS/MAPK/ERK, which regulate cell proliferation, survival and the metastatic dissemination (Arteaga & Engelman, 2014; Haikala & Janne, 2021). Multiple HER2-targeted therapies, including the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab and small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been approved for the treatment of HER2-overexpressing (HER2+) breast cancer (Goutsouliak et al, 2020). Application of anti-HER2 agents in combination with chemotherapy has significantly improved the patients‚Äô outcome. However, patients initially responsive to the HER2 inhibitors (HER2is) almost inevitably succumb to disease relapse (Goutsouliak et al., 2020). Moreover, HER2+ breast tumors have an inherent tendency to develop brain metastasis, a significant clinical challenge for the treatment of these patients (Fecci et al, 2019). Therefore, there is a pressing need for novel and more efficacious therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance to HER2is. '\n",

Consistent with the effects of HER3 overexpression, the HER3 ligand neuregulin (NRG, a.k.a Heregulin; HRG) promotes trastuzumab resistance in HER2+ breast cancer cells (Haikala & Janne, 2021). Importantly, the NRG-HER3 axis also promotes resistance to a wide range of TKIs and chemotherapies (Erjala et al, 2006; Haikala & Janne, 2021; Knuefermann et al, 2003; Recondo et al, 2020; Wilson et al., 2012; Yonesaka et al, 2011). Despite the importance of HER3 in cancer progression and therapy resistance, development of HER3 small molecule inhibitors has been challenging due to its impaired kinase activity (Haikala & Janne, 2021; Xie et al, 2014). Moreover, the clinical activity of HER3 monoclonal antibodies either as monotherapies or in combination with chemo- and targeted therapies have been marginal (Cleary et al, 2017; Haikala & Janne, 2021; Schneeweiss et al, 2018). To this end, there is a pressing need to identify novel strategies to inhibit HER3 activity and/or expression for the treatment of HER3-dependent human malignancies (Gaborit et al, 2015; Haikala & Janne, 2021; Xie et al., 2014).

      "ele.tag='{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}p' | ele.text='There is emerging evidence that phosphatases are novel and ‚Äúdruggable‚Äù targets in oncology (Lazo et al, 2018; Vainonen et al, 2021). Inhibition of oncogenic phosphatases, or re-activation of tumor suppressor phosphatases, by small molecule therapies halt tumor growth, retard malignant progression, and enhance therapeutic sensitivity in various neoplasms (Lazo et al., 2018; Vainonen et al., 2021). Despite this, the contribution of phosphatases to resistance to HER2is is still poorly understood. Dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) belong to the superfamily of protein tyrosine phosphatases and dephoshorylate both tyrosines and serines or threonines. A subgroup of the DUSPs are mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatases that selectively interact with and dephosphorylate the MAPKs (Patterson et al, 2009; Zandi et al, 2022). For instance, DUSP6 displays a high degree of substrate selectivity for the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), but not P38 or c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (Zandi et al., 2022). However, recent studies indicate that at least some cancer relevant DUSP6 functions may by ERK-independent (Kong et al, 2023). DUSP6 is indicated in clinical cancer progression, and its genetic inhibition prevents tumor cell growth  (Shojaee et al, 2015; Wu et al, 2018). Notably, DUSP6 is a druggable phosphatase (Korotchenko et al, 2014; Molina et al, 2009; Vainonen et al., 2021; Zandi et al., 2022). The best characterized DUSP6 inhibitor molecule BCI ((E)-2-Benzylidene-3-(cyclohexylamino)-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-one), is a semi-allosteric inhibitor of both DUSP1 and 6 that phenocopies genetic DUSP6 inhibition in several cancer models  (Kong et al., 2023; Korotchenko et al., 2014; Molina et al., 2009; Vainonen et al., 2021). However, the role and potential of therapeutic targeting of DUSP6 in overcoming resistance to HER2is is currently unknown. '\n",

Both cell lines followed a similar pattern of lapatinib tolerance development, where at the 9-day timepoint only a few DTP cells could be microscopically observed, whereas the emergence DTEP population took about 6 months (Fig. 1A). Following this, the plates were fully populated by the LR cells after 9 months of continuous lapatinib treatment (Fig. 1A). Importantly, in addition to lapatinib, the LR clones of both BT474 and BT474Br displayed strong cross resistance to tucatinib (a HER2i), afatinib (a HER2/EGFR inhibitor), and neratinib (a HER2/HER4/EGFR inhibitor) (Figure EV1).

To this end, the transcriptional profiles from each functional state of lapatinib drug tolerance and resistance development in BT474 cells were surveyed by bulk RNA-sequencing. From three technical replicates per condition, and by using statistical criteria of |logFC|>2 and Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p <0.05, upregulation of 144, 1169 and 16 genes was found upon the control-DTP, DTP-DTEP, and DTEP-LR transitions of BT474 cells, respectively (Fig. 1B, Dataset EV1). On the other hand, the number of downregulated genes were 517, 930 and 28, respectively (Fig. 1B, Dataset EV1). The highest number of differentially regulated genes upon the DTP-DTEP transition indicates that this is the transition phase where the BT474 cell fate is most robustly impacted during the resistance development. When assessing the patterns of gene expression changes by unsupervised soft clustering analysis (Futschik & Carlisle, 2005), we identified six approximately similar size gene clusters with distinct regulation patterns (Appendix Figure S1A). The genes included in these clusters are listed in the Dataset EV2. Such regulation patterns indicate that neither gene activation nor gene repression characterize lapatinib resistance development in BT474 cells, but unique gene expression programs are involved in each of these steps.

Strikingly, most of these transcription factor binding sites were enriched also in the genes significantly upregulated in DTEP cells (Fig. 1B in bold, Dataset EV3). This indicates that these transcription factors are inactivated co-ordinately upon the development of the DTP state and re-activated upon re-growth of the DTEPs.

Protein phosphorylation is the most prevalent post-translational modification in cancer cells, and cancer cell phosphoproteomes are regulated by kinases and phosphatases. Whereas the role of kinases in non-genetic therapy tolerance development has been extensively studied (Marine et al., 2020), the importance of phosphatases to development of non-genetic kinase inhibitor therapy tolerance have been thus far poorly characterized. Therefore, we focused on the dynamics of phosphatase gene regulation during lapatinib tolerance development. Importantly, there were only four phosphatase genes (CDC25A, CDC25C, DUSP6 and SYNJ1) that were synchronously downregulated in DTP cells but upregulated in DTEPs versus DTPs (Fig. 2A-C, Dataset EV1). We rationalized that these four phosphatases might be particularly relevant for allowing the regrowth of the DTEP population under continuous lapatinib treatment. Even though a large group of other genes were found differentially regulated between the DTEP and LR populations (Fig. 1B, Dataset EV1 and EV2), none of the phosphatase genes were significantly regulated in the DTEP-LR transition (Dataset EV1).

We confirmed differential expression of DUSP6 across different resistance acquisition transitions in BT474 cells. Consistent with the RNA sequencing results (Fig. 2C), DUSP6 protein expression was strongly induced upon the DTP-DTEP transition (Fig. 3A). While the DUSP6 mRNA levels were diminished in the fully resistant LR clones compared to DTEPs (Fig. 2C), its protein levels remained robustly elevated presumably via post-translational stabilization mechanisms (Fig. 3A). Validating that these effects were not cell line specific, DUSP6 protein was also increased in BT474BrLR cells as compared to the parental cells (Appendix Figure 3A). We further validated inhibition of DUSP6 upon DTP phase across independent set of lapatinib treated HER2+ cells including BT474Br, and two cell lines (EFM192A, HCC1419) from (Data ref:(Chang et al., 2022)( GSE155342), or NSCLC, melanoma, and colorectal cancer cells de novo treated with various TKIs (Fig. 3B). Therefore, inhibition of DUSP6 expression appears as a general mechanism associated with establishment of TKI-induced therapy tolerance. Selected E2F1 and FOXM1 target genes were also confirmed to be downregulated in TKI-treated NSCLC, MM, and CRC DTP cells (Appendix Figure S3B). Notably, among the transcription factors differentially implicated upon HER2i tolerance development (Fig. 1B), forkhead box transcription factor M1\\xa0 (FOXM1) and NFYA bind to DUSP6 promoter (Dataset EV4), and coinciding with DUSP6 expression, FOXM1 gene expression is downregulated in DTPs and upregulated in DTEPs (Appendix Figure S3C). Functionally, a small molecule inhibitor of FOXM1 (FDI-6) \\xa0(Wang et al, 2021) inhibited DUSP6 expression in a time-dependent fashion in BT474 cells (Appendix Figure S3D,E).

Importantly, DUSP6 overexpression was able to dampen both cell viability inhibition, and apoptosis induction, by all four tested HER2is (Fig. 3D,E and Figure EV3A-D). Mechanistically, the anti-apoptotic activity of DUSP6 in lapatinib treated BT474 cells appeared to be independent of ERK MAPK regulation, as overexpression of the KIM mutant of DUSP6 (R64A,R65A), incapable in ERK binding (Nichols et al, 2000), had equally strong impact as the wild-type DUSP6 (Fig. 3F and Appendix Figure S3F). ERK-independent antiapoptotic activity for DUSP6 in cancer cells was suggested also recently (Kong et al., 2023). As a complementary pharmacological  approach, BT474 cells were treated with lapatinib or neratinib alone, or in combination with small molecule DUSP6 inhibitor BCI for 6 months. BCI is a semi-allosteric inhibitor of both DUSP1 and DUSP6 and several studies have demonstrated that BCI phenocopies genetic DUSP6 inhibition in cancer (Kong et al., 2023; Ramkissoon et al, 2019; Shojaee et al., 2015). Notably, as compared to the monotherapies, combination with BCI preempted the DTEP development in both lapatinib and neratinib treated cells (Fig. 3G). Strongly indicative of selective drug interaction rather than overall toxicity by BCI, the BCI used at the given concentration for 6 months did not kill all BT474 cells but potently synergized with the HER2is (Fig. 3G). The fact that DUSP6 overexpression inhibited HER2i-elicited cell killing (Fig. 3E), whereas BCI abrogated development of HER2i tolerant cells (Fig. 3G), strongly support selective effects for BCI on DUSP6. Indeed, the role of DUSP1 as a primary BCI target was overruled by the results that  DUSP1 was neither expressed at the protein level in BT474 cells (Fig. 3A), nor its mRNA was found differentially regulated between any of the acquired resistance phases (Fig. 2A, B, Dataset EV1). In harmony, DUSP1 overexpression had clearly weaker activity than DUSP6 overexpression in the rescue experiments (Figure EV3D). To further validate the selectivity of BCI as a DUSP6 inhibitor, we generated DUSP6 knockout (DUSP6KO) MDA-MB-453 cells by CRISPR/CAS9 (Appendix Figure S3G). Indeed, three independent single cell clones of DUSP6KO cells were significantly less sensitive to BCI-elicited inhibition of cell viability as compared to the control cells (Appendix Figure S3H).

To this end, we compared pharmacological DUSP6 targeting against a library of available small molecule modulators of other phosphatases (Lazo et al., 2018; Vainonen et al., 2021). Across either HER2i resistant cells lines, inhibition of cell viability by phosphatase targeting was observed only with DUSP6 inhibitor BCI, its derivative BCI-215, and with FTY-720 that reactivates protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) by SET inhibition (Saddoughi et al, 2013)(Figure EV4). The phenocopying results between BCI and BCI-215 is an important additional evidence for the selectivity of BCI type of drugs towards DUSPs, as BCI-215 was demonstrated to  activate only the DUSP1 and 6 target MAPKs among the 43 tested kinases (Chan et al, 2020; Kaltenmeier et al, 2017). Based on the response to kinase inhibitors and anti-apoptotic antagonists, the cells that are HER2i resistant, but sensitive to DUSP6 inhibition, are co-dependent on PI3K/AKT, PLK1 and AXL kinase activities, and on the anti-apoptotic proteins IkB, survivin, cIAP and/or XIAP (Figure EV4). Further corroborating the role for DUSP6 as the anti-apoptotic target in stably HER2i resistance cells, siRNA-mediated depletion of DUSP6 induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-453 cells (Fig. 4A). This was not seen with DUSP1 inhibition (Fig. 4A). DUSP6 depletion also induced apoptosis in another HER2i resistant HER2+ cell line MDA-MB-361 (Appendix Figure S4A). Furthermore, independent clones of CRISPR/CAS9 targeted MDA-MB-453 DUSP6 KO cells showed impaired long-term colony growth potential (Fig. 4B). This was due to loss of DUSP6 expression, as lentiviral re-expression of DUSP6 rescued the phenotype (Appendix Figure S4B-E). '\n",

These results also validate that DUSP6 inhibition sensitizes to HER2 inhibition regardless of whether small molecule inhibitors or therapeutic antibody (trastuzumab) is used. The impact of genetic DUSP6 targeting in HER2i sensitization was recapitulated by BCI treatment (Fig. 4D). Additionally, DUSP6 depletion increased sensitivity to the combination of neratinib and capecitabine (Fig. 4E), which is a combination therapy in clinical use (Saura et al, 2020). Furthermore, DUSP6 depletion enhanced sensitivity to the combination of tucatinib+trastuzumab+capecitabine (Appendix Figure S4G), which improves progression free survival and overall survival in patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer (Murthy et al, 2020).

To start with, we evaluated the impact of CRISPR/CAS9-mediated DUSP6 knockout on the    xenograft growth of MDA-MB-453 cells in immunocompromised BALB/cOlaHsd-Foxn1nu mice. Importantly, the two DUSP6 KO clones showed significant and indistinguishable antitumor effects as compared to the control cells (Fig. 5A). Next, we asked whether pharmacological DUSP6 blockade overcomes HER2i resistance in vivo. For this purpose, we used two different HER2+ cell models, MDA-MB-453 or HCC1954. When xenografts with these two cell lines had reached the approximate size of 100 mm3, the mice were randomized into four treatment groups; vehicle, lapatinib/neratinib (50 mg/kg), BCI (50 mg/kg), and lapatinib/neratinib+BCI. Importantly, validating the in vivo HER2i resistance of both chosen HER2+ cell models, tumors from both cell lines were fully resistant to clinically relevant doses of either lapatinib or neratinib (Fig. 5B-E). Notably, both MDA-MB-453 and HCC1954 tumors also displayed strong resistance to BCI monotherapy (Fig. 5B-E), indicating for tumor microenvironment-mediated impact as compared to the in vitro cultures. However, combination of BCI very efficiently preempted the lapatinib or neratinib resistance phenotype (Fig. 5B-E). Indicating for potential clinical utility, DUSP6 and HER2-targeted therapies displayed a clear synthetic lethal drug interaction when assessed by a waterfall blot in both cell models (Fig. 5C, E). The dramatic combinatorial activity of DUSP6 and HER2 targeting on cellular viability was also evidenced by lack of cytoplasmic eosin staining of the MDA-MB-453 xenograft tumor after 24 d of treatment (Fig. 5F). Consistent with previous studies with BCI (Kesarwani et al, 2017; Ramkissoon et al., 2019; Shojaee et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2018), we did not observe any apparent signs of toxicity or weight loss (Appendix Figure S4D) in any treatment groups. In addition, normal fibroblasts displayed several folds decreased sensitivity to BCI in an in vitro cell viability assay (Appendix Figure S4E), further indicating for a favorable dose-window between impact of DUSP6 inhibition in HER2i resistance, and its effects to normal cells.

On the other hand, PI3K/AKT activation was one of the DUSP6-driven hallmark gene sets associated with the DTP-DTEP transition (Fig. 1C and 3F). Therefore, it was relevant to compare the quantitative and qualitative differences between DUSP6 blockade versus AKT inhibition in combination with the HER2i in the resistant models. Having demonstrated phenocopying growth effects between genetic DUSP6 inhibition and BCI, as well as resistance of DUSP KO cells to BCI, these experiments were mostly performed by comparing the compounds MK2206 (AKTi) and BCI (DUSP6i) as the alternative pharmacological HER2i combination approaches.

Further, compensatory induction of HER3 is thought to be one of the primary mechanisms behind the resistance to the combination of HER2 inhibition and AKT targeting (Chandarlapaty et al, 2011; Wilson et al., 2012). Accordingly, AKT inhibition resulted in HER3 induction in MDA-MBA-453 cells treated with either MK2206 alone, and with MK2206-lapatinib combination (Fig. 6C,E). Pharmacological inhibition of the AKT upstream kinase PI3K also induced HER3 expression (Appendix Figure S5C). In contrast, BCI decreased HER2 and HER3 expressions as a monotherapy, and in combination with lapatinib (Fig. 6C, F). Notably, both HER2 and HER3 were downregulated 3 h already after BCI treatment, and this coincided with the induction of ERK phosphorylation, and destabilization of DUSP6, both serving as signs for BCI target engagement (Fig. 6G). Accordingly, siRNA-mediated knockdown of DUSP6 reduced HER2 and HER3 protein levels in MDA-MB-453, HCC1954, and the HER3+ triple negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 (Fig. 6H and Appendix Figures S5D,E). Indicative of transcriptional regulation, DUSP6 inhibition decreased HER2 and HER3 mRNA expression, but did not impact HER2 and HER3 protein stability (Appendix Figure S5F,G). Further, indicative of selective effects on HER2 and HER3 among the ERBB receptors, EGFR expression was unaffected by DUSP6 targeting in MDA-MB-468 (Appendix Figure S5E). The tumor material from the BCI-treated MDA-MB-453 xenograft model was further used for in vivo validation of HER3 as DUSP6 downstream target. Indeed, BCI-treated tumors displayed vastly decreased tumor cell immunopositivity for HER3, and to lesser extent HER2 (Fig. 6I). Finally, clinically high DUSP6 tumors had significantly higher expression of tyrosine 1298 phosphorylated HER3 (Fig. 6J).'\n",

On the other hand, our results indicate that DUSP6 may drive HER2i resistance by promoting the expression of HER3. With this background, we compared the capacity of DUSP6 and AKT inhibition to reverse HER2i tolerance by the NRG/HER3 axis. As expected, (Kodack et al., 2017; Leung et al., 2015), NRG treatment induced tolerance to both neratinib and lapatinib across all four tested primarily sensitive cell lines (Fig. 7A and Appendix Figure S6A). The NRG-mediated rescue from both HER2is was abrogated in a concentration dependent manner after treatment with BCI, but not with MK2206 (Fig. 7A and Appendix Figure S6A). The only exception was HCC2218 cells, in which also MK2206 reversed NRG-elicited HER2i tolerance (Fig. 7A and Appendix Figure S6A). These results were validated at the level of differential apoptosis induction between DUSP6 and AKT targeting. Whereas NRG completely prevented HER2i-elicited induction of apoptosis in BT474 cells, and AKT inhibition could not reverse this, DUSP6 inhibition restored the apoptotic activity (Fig. 7B). On the other hand, RNAi-mediated HER3 knockdown triggered apoptosis in MDA-MB-453 cells (Appendix Figure S6B). To functionally prove that inhibition of HER3 expression mediates BCI effects, we performed a rescue experiment in MDA-MB-453 cells with ectopic stable overexpression of HER3 under heterologous CMV promoter (Appendix Figure S6C).

Indeed, DUSP6 mRNA expression was potently inhibited already with the smallest tested concentration of neratinib or lapatinib in the HER2i sensitive cells (BT474, BT474Br) (Fig. 8A and Appendix Figure S7A; in green). However, among the HER2i resistant cell lines, DUSP6 was not inhibited by HER2is in MDA-MB-361, MDA-MB-453, BT474Br-LR, and BT474-LR cells, whereas HCC1954 showed an intermediate phenotype (Fig. 8A and Appendix Figure S7A; in red). Additionally, this regulation was specific to DUSP6, as DUSP1 mRNA expression was not inhibited by HER2 targeting in any of the tested cell modes (Fig. 8A and Appendix Figure S7A). Clinically DUSP6 and HER3 mRNA expression also correlated in HER2+ cancer samples in the TCGA-BRCA dataset (Cerami et al., 2012)(Appendix Figure S7B). Differential regulation of DUSP6 expression by HER2i in sensitive (BT474Br, BT474) versus resistant (MDA-MB-361, MDA-MB-453, BT474BrLR) cells was validated at the protein level by western blotting (Fig. 8B,C and Figure EV5). Importantly, RNAi-mediated knockdown of HER3 decreased DUSP6 expression (Fig. 8D). HER3 dependent DUSP6 regulation was further supported by induction of DUSP6 mRNA and protein expression by treatment of serum-starved BT474 or BT474Br cells with the HER3 ligand NRG (Fig. 8E, F and Appendix Figures S7C,D).  Induction of DUSP6 was selective for NRG, since hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which activates MET RTK, failed to increase DUSP6 in BT474 cells (Appendix Figure S7C,D). To gain insights into the mechanism by which HER3 regulates DUSP6, the NRG treated cells were co-treated either with AKTi MK2206, or the MEK1/2 inhibitor trametinib. Consistent with a previous report that DUSP6 is a transcriptional ERK1/2 target (Zandi et al., 2022), treatment with trametinib inhibited both ERK phosphorylation and DUSP6 expression in all tested cell lines (Fig. 8E-G and Appendix Figure S7E), whereas AKT inhibition by MK2206 further increased DUSP6 expression (Fig. 8E-G).

It is commonly believed that transition from dormant DTPs to proliferating DTEPs is a pivotal step towards development of the disseminated disease, and eventually late-stage genetic changes which determine the ultimate therapy resistance (Aguirre-Ghiso, 2021; Marine et al., 2020). Here, we report the first transcriptomic analysis of the DTP-DTEP transition in TKI treated cancer cells. In addition to importance of the discovery of the role of DUSP6 in DTP-DTEP transition, the transcriptome data will provide a rich resource for future studies to understand different stages of the HER2i resistance development. Based on the fuzzy clustering data (Appendix figure S1 and Dataset EV2), the gene clusters 1, 2 and 6, contain genes that are strongly regulated upon the DTP-DTEP transition and are therefore contain many additional genes involved in the evasion of the DTP cells from lapatinib-induced growth inhibition. The longitudinal transcriptomics profiles also allowed us to identify potential master transcription factors involved in the lapatinib resistance development. The functional relevance of the differentially expressed genes associated with each therapy tolerance transition obviously need to be validated in future studies stemming from this novel resource.

However, their contribution to development of non-genetic TKI therapy tolerance is still poorly understood. In the present study, we asked which phosphatases might contribute to the development of HER2i tolerance and resistance and explored their potential role as therapy targets in combination with the HER2i therapies in HER2+ breast cancer. Via transcriptomics analysis of lapatinib tolerance development over six months, we discovered an important role for DUSP6 in the re-growth of HER2i tolerant cells and showed that its genetic and pharmacological blockade potentiates HER2i sensitivity in vitro and in vivo in multiple different HER2+ cell models. Mechanistically, we discovered that transcriptional DUSP6 inhibition is an important contributor to effective HER2i response whereas the lack of HER2i-elicited DUSP6 inhibition in the resistant cells provides a novel explanation for drug resistance in these cells (Fig. 8H). We further discovered DUSP6 as a novel activator of HER3 expression and demonstrated that HER3 inhibition is a prerequisite for the therapeutic impact of DUSP6 inhibition. Inhibition of HER3 by DUSP6 targeting appears also an important mechanistic explanation for the superior apoptotic activity as compared to PI3K/AKT targeting in combination with HER2i. As we demonstrate, the therapeutic impact of DUSP6 targeting is not compromised by the NRG-mediated feedback to HER3 as is the case with AKT targeting and thereby our data identify DUSP6 targeting as a novel approach to target NRG-HER3 axis to overcome HER2i resistance. These are important advantages favoring DUSP6 blockade versus AKT inhibition as a future strategy for treatment of HER2+ breast cancer. A particularly important translational finding in our study is that DUSP6 defines therapy sensitivity of the lapatinib resistant cells in response to several ERBB TKIs with different specificities, and to their chemotherapy combinations. This is consistent with the proposed HER3-DUSP6 positive feedback mechanism, as HER3 or NRG overexpression confer resistance to several cancer drugs  (Erjala et al., 2006; Haikala & Janne, 2021; Knuefermann et al., 2003; Recondo et al., 2020; Wilson et al., 2012; Yonesaka et al., 2011). Thereby identification of DUSP6 targeting as a novel approach for HER3 inhibition may have broad ramifications in different combination therapy settings across different cancer types.  HER2 and 3 play also essential roles in the development of brain metastasis which causes death of more than 30% of stage IV HER2+ breast cancer patients (Berghoff et al, 2014; Da Silva et al., 2010; Fecci et al., 2019). To this end, DUSP6-mediated regulation of HER2 and 3 suggested that its inhibition may retard development of brain metastasis. Indeed, our findings directly support these conclusions as DUSP6 knockout in tumor cells improves survival of mice with intracranial HER2+ tumors and the outgrowth of HER2+ breast tumor cells in a zebrafish intracranial model. Linking our results further to future therapy of HER2+ brain metastasis, we showed that DUSP6 knockdown increases sensitivity to tucatinib+trastuzumab+capecitabine combination regimen, which show significant clinical activity in HER2+ breast cancer patients with brain metastasis (Murthy et al., 2020).

      "ele.tag='{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}p' | ele.text='While demonstrated here for the first time in the context of HER2i therapy resistance, genetic DUSP6 inhibition has recently been shown to inhibit malignant phenotypes in other cancer types (Shojaee et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2018; Zandi et al., 2022). Consistent with these reports, genetic inhibition of DUSP6 in our study resulted in significant inhibition of HER2+ breast cancer cell viability, HER2i resistance, colony forming potential, and in vivo tumor growth. Mechanistically, DUSP6 inhibition converted cytostatic response to HER2i to an apoptotic response, which is considered as a paramount for cancer therapy strategies aiming for cancer cure. On the other hand, overexpression of DUSP6 converted HER2i sensitive cells to resistant in both cell viability and apoptosis assays.  Importantly, all our main conclusions remained valid regardless of whether DUSP6 was inhibited either by siRNA, CRISPR/CAS9, or by pharmacological inhibitors BCI and BCI-215. We further demonstrated nearly immediate target engagement, as well as resistance of three independent DUSP6 knock-out clones to BCI-elicited cell viability inhibition. Therefore, together with recent results from the others (Kong et al., 2023; Shojaee et al., 2015), we are confident that the results achieved by BCI and BCI-215 are dependent on their inhibitory effects on DUSP6 despite a recent report questioned their selectivity using other cellular system (Thompson et al, 2022).'\n",

In that regard, our xenograft results demonstrate significant potential for pharmacological DUSP6 inhibition in overcoming HER2i resistance in vivo by using two different HER2i resistant cell lines, and two different HER2is. Whereas neither HER2 nor DUSP6 inhibition alone did not have therapeutic effect on tumors, the combination showed very potent synthetic lethal phenotype further validating our in vitro results. The lack of monotherapy effect of BCI, combined with clear evidence for downstream target mechanism engagement in vivo also alleviates concerns about overall cellular toxicity behind the BCI-elicited HER2i synergy. This is consistent with previous findings demonstrating antitumor effects with BCI and BCI-215 without obvious systemic toxicity in in vivo models of gastric cancer, leukemia, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (Kesarwani et al., 2017; Ramkissoon et al., 2019; Shojaee et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2018).

Primary treatments for hydrocephalus mainly involve neurosurgical cerebrospinal fluid diversion, which hold high morbidity and failure rates, highlighting the necessity for the discovery of novel therapeutic approaches. Although the pathophysiology of hydrocephalus is highly multifactorial, impaired function of the brain ependymal cells plays a fundamental role in hydrocephalus. Here we show that GemC1 and McIdas, key regulators of multiciliated ependymal cell fate determination, induce direct cellular reprogramming towards ependyma. Our study reveals that ectopic expression of GemC1 and McIdas reprograms cortical astrocytes and programs mouse embryonic stem cells into ependyma. McIdas is sufficient to establish functional activity in the reprogrammed astrocytes. Furthermore, we show that McIdas‚Äô expression promotes ependymal cells regeneration in two different postnatal hydrocephalus mouse models: an intracranial hemorrhage and a genetic form of hydrocephalus and ameliorates the cytoarchitecture of the neurogenic niche. Our study provides evidence on the restoration of ependyma in animal models mimicking hydrocephalus that could be exploited towards future therapeutic interventions. '\n",

      "ele.tag='{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}p' | ele.text='Hydrocephalus is a neurological disorder defined by the abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the brain ventricles, leading to increased head circumference (Schrander-Stumpel & Fryns, 1998). The condition can arise as a primary clinical feature triggered by a genetic cause (congenital hydrocephalus) or secondary (acquired hydrocephalus) to other insults such as central nervous system (CNS) infections, tumors, trauma, or hemorrhage (Rekate, 2009; Kahle et al, 2016; Kousi & Katsanis, 2016). Malfunction of the ependymal cells is a leading cause of the pathophysiological mechanism of hydrocephalus as these cells have a key role in CSF circulation and composition (Ji et al, 2022). In addition, hydrocephalus is linked with disorganization of the subventricular neurogenic niche‚Äôs  cytoarchitecture and neurogenesis defects, as ependymal cells were shown to provide structural and functional support to the adult neural stem cells (Paez-Gonzalez et al, 2011; McAllister, James P. et al, 2017; Rodr√≠guez & Guerra, 2017). '\n",
      "ele.tag='{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}p' | ele.text='Under homeostatic conditions, ependymal cells form one of the largest epithelia of the brain, lying adjacent to the ventricular lumen and bear unique structural characteristics. The cell surface exposed to the ventricular lumen contains a patch of approximately 50 modified centrioles, called basal bodies, which are tiny microtubule-based organelles responsible for nucleating an equal number of motile cilia. Cilia  are anchored Œøn their apical surface, beating in the same direction and in a coordinated fashion, thus contributing to efficient CSF circulation throughout the brain (Mirzadeh et al, 2008, 2010). Constant ciliary beating facilitates secreted molecules dispersion to other regions of the CNS. Such circulating molecules in the CSF influence neurogenesis and neuroblasts‚Äô migration to the olfactory bulbs (Lim et al, 2000; Sawamoto et al, 2006). '\n",
      "ele.tag='{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}p' | ele.text=' Ependymal cell differentiation is a multi-step process orchestrated by a tightly regulated transcriptional program which is responsible for activating numerous genes that promote amplification and docking of centrioles and the formation of cilia (Kyrousi et al, 2017; Arbi et al, 2018). We have previously provided evidence that the Geminin family proteins, GEMC1 and MCIDAS, are the earliest regulators for the cell fate commitment to the ependymal lineage (Kyrousi et al, 2015). GemC1 lies upstream of McIdas inducing its transcriptional activation, while both upregulate genes that are essential for centriole amplification and for promoting the downstream transcriptional machinery of multiciliogenesis (Kyrousi et al, 2015; Arbi et al, 2016; Lalioti et al, 2019a). GEMC1 and MCIDAS cooperate with E2F4/5 transcription factors, to upregulate cMyb and Ccno, which are implicated in centriole amplification (Tan et al, 2013; Wallmeier et al, 2014; Funk et al, 2015; Arbi et al, 2018). In addition, we and others have provided evidence that GemC1 and McIdas drive the transcriptional activation of P73 and FOXJ1 transcription factors, which are implicated in basal bodies docking and cilia motility (Kyrousi et al, 2015; Arbi et al, 2016; Nemajerova et al, 2016; Marshall et al, 2016; Lalioti et al, 2019a). '\n",
      "ele.tag='{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}p' | ele.text='Given the multifaceted roles that ependymal cells have in hydrocephalus pathophysiology, restoration of ependymal cells could significantly contribute to hydrocephalus therapy. With the advancements in direct reprogramming-based strategies for conditions affecting the central nervous system (Bocchi et al, 2022), it is plausible to anticipate that cellular reprogramming directed towards ependymal cells could represent a significant breakthrough in the treatment of hydrocephalus. In the present study we showed that ectopic expression of GemC1 or McIdas promotes programming of mouse pluripotent embryonic stem cells and reprogramming of cortical astrocytes into ependymal cells, with McIdas being more efficient on establishing functional motile cilia in reprogrammed astrocytes. In addition, forced expression of McIdas in both a genetic and an acquired hydrocephalus mouse model promoted in vivo reprogramming of cells residing in the ventricular walls of the diseased brain into functional ependymal cells. Importantly, reprogrammed ependymal cells were able to beat their cilia in a coordinated fashion and formed pinwheel structures together with neural stem cells in hydrocephalic mice, revealing their potential to regenerate the architecture of the neurogenic niche, which is disrupted in hydrocephalus. Collectively, our data suggest that GEMC1 and MCIDAS can orchestrate the transcriptional program of multiciliogenesis establishing ependymal cell fate and differentiation, providing proof of principle evidence that restoration of ependymal cells could potentially contribute to hydrocephalus management.

      "ele.tag='{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}p' | ele.text='GemC1 and McIdas are the most upstream regulators driving multiciliogenesis in vertebrate organisms (Stubbs et al, 2012; Ma et al, 2014; Boon et al, 2014; Kyrousi et al, 2015; Terr√© et al, 2016; Arbi et al, 2016). We therefore postulated that GemC1 and McIdas would be capable of inducing stem cell programming towards multiciliated ependymal cells. To examine this hypothesis, mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) were transfected with plasmids encoding McIdas or GemC1 in conjunction with GFP (referred to as McIdas and GemC1 respectively), or GFP alone as a control. Transfected mESCs were cultured for four days in the absence of Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) and subjected to immunostaining for FoxJ1, a key transcription factor for the differentiation of ependymal cells, and Pericentrin which marks nascent basal bodies (Fig EV1A). Our analysis showed that 87% of McIdas- and 39% of GemC1-overexpressing mESCs were expressing FoxJ1, while only 1% FoxJ1 positive cells were detected in the control (Fig EV1B). In addition, we identified that 90% of McIdas- and 59% of GemC1-overexpressing mESCs showed accumulation of Pericentrin staining (Fig EV1C), thus presented multiple nascent basal bodies, corresponding to differentiating ependymal cells. Furthermore, we examined whether McIdas and GemC1-overexpressing mESCs acquire multiple cilia, a unique structural characteristic of the ependymal cells. Double immunofluorescence experiments were performed six days following mESCs transfection using anti-Pericentrin and anti-acetylated-a-tubulin antibodies to mark the basal bodies and cilia, respectively (Fig EV1D). Our analysis revealed that 66% of McIdas- and 21% of GemC1- overexpressing mESCs develop multiple cilia arising from numerous basal bodies.  On the contrary, control mESCs develop neither multiple basal bodies nor cilia (Fig EV1D, E). Our data show that ectopic expression of McIdas and GemC1 programs mESCs into multiciliated ependymal cells. '\n",
      "ele.tag='{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}p' | ele.text='Next, we sought out to explore the reprogramming potential of McIdas and GemC1 in astrocytes that under physiological conditions do not differentiate into ependymal cells. Astrocytes were isolated from the cortex of neonatal mice and were subsequently infected with lentiviruses expressing GFP-McIdas or GFP-GemC1 (referred to as McIdas and GemC1, respectively), while lentiviruses expressing GFP alone were used as control. Cells were subsequently cultured under differentiating conditions and immunofluorescence experiments were conducted to assess the expression of known ependymal and astrocytic markers (Fig. 1A). Ectopic expression of both McIdas and GemC1 resulted in P73 expression, a marker of the early steps of ependymogenesis, in 37% and 36% of McIdas- and GemC1- infected cells, respectively, while in the control condition only 4% of the transduced cells was expressing P73 (Fig. 1B, C, and EV 2A, B). Notably, concurrent changes in the expression pattern of the astrocytic marker S100Œ≤ were observed in approximately 20% of McIdas- and 18% of GemC1- infected astrocytes, as S100Œ≤ expression was detected around their cell body, which is characteristic for ependymal cells (Mirzadeh et al, 2008) (Fig. 1B-D and EV. 2A-C). On the contrary, control astrocytes retained a cytoplasmic expression of the S100Œ≤ protein, a typical feature of astrocytes.  Overall, our data suggest that ectopic expression of McIdas and GemC1 can lead to the acquisition of the ependymal cell fate. '\n",
      "ele.tag='{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}p' | ele.text='Subsequently, we examined whether McIdas- and GemC1-transduced astrocytes successfully differentiate into ependymal cells. We performed immunofluorescence experiments using specific antibodies recognizing FoxJ1 and Pericentrin, to identify astrocytes that acquired the ependymal fate and successfully managed to multiply their basal bodies, respectively. Our analysis showed that fourteen days post infection 49% of McIdas- and 19% of GemC1- infected astrocytes were expressing FoxJ1 (Fig. 1E, F and EV2D, E). In addition, 28% of the McIdas- and 12% of GemC1- infected astrocytes possessed multiple basal bodies, indicated by the accumulation of Pericentrin signal (Fig. 1G and EV2F). Moreover, expression of a GFP lentivirus did not result into FoxJ1 expression nor accumulation of Pericentrin. '\n",
      "ele.tag='{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}p' | ele.text='In addition, we examined the ability of McIdas and GemC1 to repress the astrocytic identity of the transduced astrocytes. Towards this direction, the combined expression of the astrocytic markers GFAP and S100Œ≤ was assessed through immunofluorescence experiments at fourteen days post infection. Our analysis revealed that McIdas ectopic expression resulted to 23% of GFAP+/S100Œ≤+ double positive cells compared to 31% in the control condition (Appendix Fig. S1A, B). We did not observe statistically significant change in the percentage of GFAP+/S100Œ≤+ double positive cells following GemC1 ectopic expression (Appendix Fig. S1C). In addition, we examined the percentage of infected cells that were GFAP- and reveal S100Œ≤ expression around the cell body, which correspond to ependymal cells. We showed that 28% McIdas- and 22% GemC1- infected astrocytes present this expression pattern (Appendix Fig. S1A, B), which is in accordance with our analysis performed in earlier stages of reprogramming (Fig. 1D). Our results indicate that a significant percentage of the infected astrocytes are reprogrammed to the ependymal lineage and possess unique ependymal morphological characteristics. Moreover, we showed that McIdas is more potent in the downregulation of the astrocytic identity of the transduced cells. '\n",
      "ele.tag='{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}p' | ele.text='GemC1 is positioned upstream of McIdas in the molecular pathway governing ependymogenesis, as it regulates the transcriptional activation of McIdas and controls the initial fate commitment towards the ependymal lineage (Kyrousi et al, 2015, 2017). Our results suggest that GemC1 was less effective than McIdas in reprogramming of astrocytes. We have therefore examined whether ectopic expression of GemC1 in astrocytes would not induce McIdas expression at sufficient levels. To test this hypothesis, we conducted immunofluorescence experiments using an McIdas specific antibody and quantified McIdas fluorescence in McIdas- and GemC1-infected astrocytes seven days post infection (Appendix Fig. S2A). Our results revealed that McIdas‚Äô ectopic expression led to higher expression levels compared to GemC1 (Appendix Fig. S2B), providing a potential mechanism for their differential ability to induce reprogramming.

      "ele.tag='{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}p' | ele.text='Given the greater capacity of McIdas to induce the ependymal differentiation in astrocytes compared to GemC1, we hypothesized that McIdas would reprogram cortical astrocytes into fully mature ependymal cells carrying multiple basal bodies nucleating motile cilia. To address this point, we initially performed immunofluorescence experiments in transduced astrocytes twenty-two days post infection using antibodies against Centriolin (also known as Cep110), a known centrosomal marker, and Meig1 which was recently characterized as ependymal cell marker (MacDonald et al, 2021). We detected accumulation of both Centriolin (Appendix Fig.S3A) and Meig1 (Appendix Fig.S3B) signal in McIdas-infected astrocytes, verifying the generation of multiple basal bodies upon McIdas‚Äô ectopic expression. Next, we performed immunofluorescence experiments making use of antibodies against acetylated a-tubulin, which stains ciliary axonemes, and the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). The ectopic expression of McIdas resulted in the downregulation of GFAP expression and the generation of multiple cilia on the surface of the reprogrammed astrocytes, revealing the loss of the astrocytic identity and the establishment of the ependymal differentiation (Fig. 2A). Our analysis showed that 18% of McIdas- infected astrocytes were reprogrammed into multiciliated ependymal cells based on acetylated-a-tubulin staining (Fig. 2C), which was consistent with the percentage of McIdas- infected cells that downregulate the expression of the astrocytic marker GFAP (Fig. 2B). Additionally, live imaging microscopy experiments were performed in transduced astrocytes twenty-two days post infection to address the ability of the reprogrammed astrocytes multicilia to beat (Movies EV1-4). Using high-speed video microscopy, we acquired fast video recordings from GFP (Movies EV1-2) and McIdas- infected astrocytes (Movies EV3-4), which revealed the presence of ciliary motility in McIdas- infected cells as opposed to the absence of motility in GFP- infected cells. Importantly, our analysis showed that McIdas expression established cilia movement that was sufficient to propel fluorescent particles added to the imaging medium, highlighting the functionality of the ependymal cells and their capability to create a fluid flow. On the contrary, astrocytes infected with a control virus were unable to propel the fluorescent particles, as were only observed to have a rather stable forward and backward motion (Fig. 2D). '\n",

Based on our finding that McIdas can successfully reprogram cortical astrocytes into functional ependymal cells, we examined whether McIdas could induce direct reprogramming of periventricular cells in hydrocephalic models. We used an established mouse model of intracranial hemorrhage hydrocephalus induced by the elevated concentration of Lysophosphatidic Acid (LPA) in the brain (Yung et al, 2015; Lummis et al, 2019), which closely mirrors the most common type of human hydrocephalus.

In addition, acetylated-a-tubulin immunofluorescence revealed the ciliary disruption in ependymal cells alongside the ventricular walls upon LPA administration (Fig. EV3C), in line with previous studies (Lummis et al, 2019). On the contrary, ependymal cells with multiple cilia covered the entire ventricular walls in control animals (Fig. EV3C). Given that the ventricular walls of the LPA-injected hydrocephalic mice were denuded from ependymal cells we wished to determine their cellular composition. We performed immunofluorescence with an antibody against the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Our analysis showed that GFAP positive cells with long processes, which likely corresponded to reactive astrocytes, covered the walls of the lateral ventricles in regions where ependymal cells localize under physiological conditions (Fig. EV3C), in line with previous findings (Roales-Buj√°n et al, 2012).

Subsequently, thick coronal brain sections at the level of the lateral ventricles were cultured and immunofluorescence was performed using established ependymal markers (Fig. 3A). Five days post electroporation, 77% of the McIdas-electroporated cells expressed P73, as opposed to 13% of the GFP-electroporated cells, suggesting that astrocytes that replaced damaged ependymal cells in LPA treated hydrocephalic mouse models acquired the ependymal fate (Fig. 3B).

Infected cells were analyzed at different time points for the expression of known ependymal markers by immunofluorescence experiments, using specific antibodies recognizing FOXJ1, Pericentrin and acetylated-a-tubulin proteins (Fig. EV4A). At five days post infection, 86% of the McIdas-infected cells expressed FoxJ1 and showed accumulation of multiple basal bodies, based on Pericentrin immunostaining (Fig. EV4B, C). Moreover, our analysis revealed that 97% of the McIdas transduced cells were multiciliated 15 days following infection, based on acetylated-a-tubulin and Pericentrin staining (Fig. EV3D, E). By contrast, in GFP transduced cells neither FoxJ1 expression nor multiple basal bodies and cilia were observed. In addition, similar experiments were performed by ectopically expressing P73 in postnatal radial glial cells isolated from GemC1-knockout mice. Ectopic expression of P73 was not sufficient to induce FoxJ1 expression nor multiple basal bodies or multiple cilia formation in GemC1-knockout radial glial cells (Fig. EV4A-E).

Reprogramming towards the ependymal cells was evaluated through immunofluorescence, using molecular markers that determine different stages of ependymogenesis. Interestingly, four days post electroporation 61% and 58% of McIdas-electroporated cells were immunopositive for the ependymal markers P73 (Fig. 4A, B) and FoxJ1, respectively (Fig. EV5A, B). The expression of P73 and FoxJ1 was not detected in control animals, in agreement to what was previously described (Lalioti et al, 2019b), as GemC1-knockout mice lack ependymal cells. We also showed that McIdas further promoted the differentiation of the electroporated ependymal cells as basal bodies amplification was observed, based on Pericentrin immunofluorescence (Fig. 4C). More specifically, upon McIdas overexpression 44% of the electroporated cells acquired multiple basal bodies (Fig. 4D). In addition, immunofluorescence against acetylated-a-tubulin revealed that McIdas overexpression resulted in the formation of cilia in a significant number of cells, corresponding to 7% of McIdas electroporated cells (Fig. 4E).

A proportion of cells with multiple beating cilia that were GFP-negative in sections derived from McIdas- electroporated brains were observed. We have previously shown that GemC1-knockout mice are unable to generate ependymal cells (Lalioti et al, 2019b), therefore cells carrying multiple beating cilia that do not appear GFP-positive were possibly observed due to the loss of the transgene because of its transient expression and were thus undetectable under the FITC filter. In addition to this, we cannot exclude the possibility of dilution of the GFP signal due to continued proliferation. In agreement with what was previously described cilia were not detected in brain sections following GFP overexpression. However, McIdas electroporated cells exhibited functional beating cilia (Fig. 5B and Movies EV5, 6). Kymographs were generated (Fig. 5C) following previously described methods by Francis et al.

To assess whether McIdas is able to restore the subventricular zone niche‚Äôs cytoarchitecture in hydrocephalic mice, whole-mount immunofluorescence was performed on ventricular walls of the lateral ventricles of GemC1-knockout hydrocephalic mice at P7-P9, previously electroporated with an McIdas-expressing plasmid or GFP alone. Specific antibodies against VCAM1 and GFAP, both markers of aNSCs, and Œ≤-catenin to delineate cell boundaries were used. Our analysis showed that McIdas-electroporated cells had a larger apical surface compared to control GFP-electroporated cells, which is characteristic for multiciliated ependymal cells. In addition, McIdas-electroporated cells were surrounding VCAM1- (Fig. 6A) and GFAP-immunopositive cells (Fig. 6B) reminiscent of pinwheel structures. On the contrary, control GFP-electroporated cells had a small apical surface and pinwheel structures were not detectable as it was previously described (Lalioti et al, 2019b). We also quantified the number of electroporated cells that were detected in pinwheel structures, revealing that 18% of McIdas-expressing cells were able to form pinwheel structures as opposed to GFP-electroporated cells that were not detected in pinwheels (Fig. 6C). Our data suggest that McIdas expression is sufficient to instruct the regeneration of ependymal cells in hydrocephalic mice which have the potential to re-build the lost architecture of the subventricular zone niche.

Reprogramming allows the conversion of differentiated cells from one lineage to another type of differentiated cell. Efficient reprogramming is highly dependent on the selection of pioneer factors related to the desired cell type. Here, we demonstrate that GEMC1 and MCIDAS, members of the geminin family, constitute potent reprogramming factors towards the ependymal fate both ex vivo and in vivo. '\n",

In addition, we have recently provided evidence that GemC1 expression is necessary and sufficient to establish the appropriate chromatin organization at multiple loci for ependymal cells differentiation (Lalioti et al, 2019b). In light of this evidence, we hypothesized that GemC1 and McIdas could promote direct reprogramming towards the ependymal lineage in different cellular populations under physiology and disease. We initially demonstrated that both GemC1 and McIdas overexpression were able to trigger the differentiation of mESCs into ependymal cells, as evidenced by the upregulation of key factors of ependymogenesis and the generation of multiple cilia in the GemC1- and McIdas overexpressing cells. We also showed that GemC1 and McIdas overexpression induce the expression of P73 and FoxJ1, two well-established transcription factors of the molecular pathway of multiciliogenesis, in cultured cortical astrocytes. Importantly, we demonstrated that GemC1 and McIdas activate the ependymal fate and induce the formation of multiple basal bodies and cilia in the reprogrammed cells. The ectopic expression of GemC1 resulted in a lower percentage of cells with multiple basal bodies, a unique structural feature of ependymal cells, revealing a differential reprogramming potential of the two factors. We showed that GemC1 does not induce sufficient levels of McIdas expression, that could contribute to the reduced ability of GemC1 to execute as efficiently the ependymal differentiation program. Moreover, using video microscopy experiments we showed that McIdas ectopic expression was sufficient to reprogram cortical astrocytes into fully functional multiciliated ependymal cells, as reprogrammed cells possessed multiple beating cilia that were able to beat in a co-ordinated way and generate fluid flow. In addition, McIdas overexpression was sufficient to induce the ependymal fate in radial glial cells derived from the brain of hydrocephalic mice in great contrast to P73, further highlighting McIdas‚Äô ability to induce the ependymal cell fate. The stem cell properties of the mESCs and radial glial cells used in our study are likely to facilitate the adoption of the ependymal fate. Since this aligns with their differentiation spectrum their conversion to ependyma could be considered as differentiation into the ependymal cell lineage. '\n",

This astrocytic scarring along the denuded ventricular wall contributes to the pathophysiology of the disease as astrocytes do not restore ependymal functions; as they do not display cilia, produce appropriate trophic signals, or facilitate the production of neurons (Sival et al, 2011; Roales-Buj√°n et al, 2012). Therefore, our strategy revealing the successful conversion of isolated cortical astrocytes into ependymal cells is of particular importance for treatment of hydrocephalus. '\n",
      "ele.tag='{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}p' | ele.text='To investigate whether McIdas would also reprogram cells in vivo, we used a mouse model of congenital hydrocephalus in which GemC1 has been inactivated, and a model of acquired hydrocephalus, triggered by intracranial hemorrhage. It was previously shown that GemC1 deficiency in mice results in the loss of the ependymal cells due to failure on activating the molecular program for the cell fate commitment towards the ependymal lineage (Terr√© et al, 2016; Lalioti et al, 2019b). Moreover, GemC1 deficiency has been recently associated with congenital hydrocephalus in both humans and mice (Lalioti et al, 2019b). In this study, we showed that McIdas forced expression induces the upregulation of P73 and FoxJ1 in brain periventricular cells, which are likely to be  neural progenitor cells or/and reactive astrocytes that have replaced the ependymal cell population in the hydrocephalic brain. The activation of the P73 and FoxJ1 genes uncovered the ability of McIdas to promote the initial steps of the ependymal cell‚Äôs differentiation program in the hydrocephalic brain. We also showed that McIdas-overexpressing cells generated multiple basal bodies and cilia, both of which are unique features of mature multiciliated ependymal cells, thus revealing the successful reprogramming towards ependyma. Importantly, the multiple cilia of the reprogrammed cells presented functional activity, as we were able to detect beating cilia upon in vivo overexpression of McIdas in the hydrocephalic mice. Using the LPA-induced intracranial hydrocephalus mouse model, we demonstrated McIdas ability to convert periventricular cells into ependymal cells. Previous study has shown that LPA causes substantial depletion of the ependymal monolayer, loss of ependymal cilia and subsequent ependymal apoptotic cell death (Lummis et al, 2019). In line with these findings, we did not observe multiciliated ependymal cells in periventricular regions after LPA treatment. Instead, we observed GFAP-positive cells, likely reactive astrocytes, covering the lateral ventricle walls where ependymal cells typically reside under normal conditions, as it has been previously shown in hydrocephalic mice (P√°ez et al, 2007; Roales-Buj√°n et al, 2012). Therefore, it is highly likely that McIdas reprograms astrocytes into ependymal cells in LPA-treated mice. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that McIdas might also enhance the survival of a subset of ependymal cells resistant to LPA-induced apoptosis.\\u200b '\n",
      "ele.tag='{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}p' | ele.text=\"Collectively, in our experiments we employed diverse cellular systems and technical approaches, including plasmid and lentiviral vectors, to induce the overexpression of McIdas and GemC1 suggesting that both GemC1 and McIdas can induce the programming or reprogramming of different cellular populations irrespectively of the cell system and vector used. While our approach in the genetic mouse model of hydrocephalus and the LPA-induced intracranial hydrocephalus likely targets periventricular cells, which are neural progenitor cells or/and reactive astrocytes, we cannot rule out the possibility that other cellular populations might also be targeted. Recent evidence from reprogramming experiments in the mouse retina and the brain indicates that the insert sequences of overexpression constructs can alter the specificity of the construct's promoter, introducing a bias toward the initial cell population being targeted (Wang et al, 2021; Le et al, 2022). Additionally, future genetic lineage analysis using transgenic mice to label neural progenitors and/or astrocytes would be needed to clarify which cell population is differentiated into ependymal cells in our approach. One of the major clinical features in human patients with hydrocephalus is the ventricular zone disruption phenomenon, characterized by the loss of neural stem cells and ependyma (McAllister, James P. et al, 2017). Of note, sustained neuron generation depends on the maintenance of the proper cytoarchitecture of the Ventricular-Subventricular Zone (V-SVZ) niche of the brain, which requires preserving the structure of the ependymal cell monolayer intact (Paez-Gonzalez et al, 2011). In the present study, we targeted V-SVZ-resident cells in the hydrocephalic brain in which McIdas overexpression was induced and observed that McIdas-overexpressing cells populated areas of the ventricular zone niche next to the lateral ventricles, where ependymal cells normally reside under homeostasis. We have used SVZ electroporation to target the periventricular cells of one lateral ventricle of the hydrocephalic brain of GemC1-knockout mice, which results to a limited number of electroporated cells.  Therefore, following this experimental approach, the small number of ependymal cells which is generated is not possible to contribute to a significant reduction in the volume of the lateral ventricles as a readout of resolved or reduced hydrocephalus. It has been described that disruption of the ventricular/subventricular zone (V/SVZ) is a critical and consistent factor in the pathophysiology of hydrocephalus (McAllister, James P. et al, 2017; Jim√©nez et al, 2014). In our study we showed that McIdas ectopic expression contributes to the restoration of the lost cytoarchitecture of the niche in hydrocephalic mice, as we identified reprogrammed ependymal cells forming pinwheel-like structures with resident neural stem cells in the targeted ventricular wall. Our findings suggest that McIdas forced expression in human patients with hydrocephalus would contribute to the re-establishment of the SVZ niche leading to brain functions‚Äô improvement by enhancing neuronal production in human patients with hydrocephalus and ameliorating brain function. The in vivo reprogramming approach indicates that the in-situ conversion of cells into ependyma in its native microenvironment is feasible. Our in vivo approach allowed the exploration of the influence of the diseased environment of the hydrocephalic brain on the reprogramming process. Our data support the idea that functional maturation and integration of the reprogrammed cells in the native tissue can be achieved through our in vivo reprogramming method. Since the molecular program of multiciliogenesis is conserved across different organisms and tissues (Arbi et al, 2018), it is tempting to speculate that such a reprogramming approach could be applied to other diseases that impact ciliated tissues, such as the lung and the reproductive system. For instance, a rare genetic disorder affecting the mucociliary clearance mechanism, known as Reduced Generation of Multiple Motile Cilia (RGMC), has been linked to mutations in MCIDAS. Therefore, it would be highly interesting to investigate whether these conditions could be addressed in the future through a genetic treatment implementing McIdas‚Äô overexpression in the affected tissue. \"\n",

Although the present study yielded intriguing findings, our implementation holds certain limitations. In particular, our in vivo studies have been conducted to mouse models of hydrocephalus. Despite sharing a similar pathophysiology with the human disease, the anatomical and physiological characteristics of the mouse and human brain possess certain differences. Therefore, to validate the effectiveness of our approach, additional experiments in disease models closer to human pathophysiology will be required. The pig model demonstrates anatomical and physiological similarities to humans and replicates the pathophysiology of human hydrocephalus, exhibiting features such as ventriculomegaly, V/SVZ disruption, and neuroinflammation and could thus be a valuable model for examining the translational success of our approach to the human conditions (Garcia-Bonilla et al, 2023). Additionally, since hydrocephalus in our study appeared during early developmental stages, our findings are particularly relevant to postnatal hydrocephalus. Therefore, their applicability to adult hydrocephalus will require further investigation using appropriate adult animal models. Although we achieved McIdas overexpression in the periventricular cells of the diseased brain through electroporation, such an approach cannot be used in humans. Therefore, alternative gene delivery methods compatible with therapeutic protocols, such as AAV gene delivery strategies in the human brain (Chamakioti et al, 2022; Au et al, 2022) should be established. Our study shows that regeneration of multiciliated ependymal cells can be succeeded in hydrocephalic mouse models while further experiments are needed to show the applicability of our findings in treating hydrocephalus in humans.'\n",

Seemingly cryptic information (time information, cell naming, filter idiosyncrasies, etc.) may allow confirmation of the identity of an image file via probabilistic inference.

We also used a larger pipeline package (en_core_web_lg, 685k unique vectors) for tokenization, which could be customized towards a specific domain, such as BioImaging. The ‚Äòdigestion‚Äô, the text that GPT-4 found in the manuscript, the labnotebook entry, and the metadata file based on the keywords are given in Table 1. It is impressive to see that even with these five simple keywords detailed descriptions can be extracted from the sources and compared. The consistency between the entries can be visualized in the form of a heatmap per keyword and source (Figure 1C). In a scenario where one of three data entries is different ‚Äì for instance, a concentration ‚Äì that value can now be corrected based on the majority of entries: the heatmap readily shows how similarity varies across the files with a ‚Äò1‚Äô describing perfect similarity. Beyond the proof of concept stage and regarding the use of large language models in general, consistency over time, correctness, hallucinations, and confidence in the answer as well as the availability of the language model need to be monitored carefully for future implementations.

Generating interpretable readouts in the form of heatmaps that highlight where metadata differs or is missing, could help to consolidate records and complete information more easily. This should improve the overall quality of reporting and future-proof the reproducibility and reusability of data for follow-up studies. Given the simplicity of the approach, it can be easily adopted, allowing image data to boldly go FAIR (where too little data has gone before). '\n",

Linking metadata sources and digesting them with language models to generate structured outputs and representations of similarity. A) Illustration of Hamming code for error correction in data transmission. Transmission of data (d) and parity (p) bits enables error correction via redundancy (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_code). B) Diagram showing the different sources of metadata information and how to bundle them. Three independent resources ‚Äì the electronic labnotebook, the data-associated metadata, and the publication ‚Äì are shown as redundant entries. An AI language model can be used to extract required and standardized data elements for verification, using codewords as a means of error correction analogous to error correction in communication. C) Heatmap display of similarities between sources by keyword. A Jupyter notebook using GPT-4 has been used to create a structured output in the form of a CSV file, (see Table 1). The digestion of a labnotebook entry, a metadata file server file, and this manuscript are used to check for keywords.
